Torrential rains batter parts of China, floods spread 
 16 Jun 2011 18:39

* Rains bring floods, landslides in centre, south * 120,000 evacuated in Zhejiang province in east 
By Chris Buckley BEIJING, June 16 (Reuters) - Pelting rain in parts of central and southern China has forced hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and prompted the government to demand safety checks on vulnerable dams, news reports said on Thursday. The torrential rains have ended a drought in many areas, but now threaten the Yangtze River basin and nearby provinces with floods and mudslides that have killed at least 105 people. In Jiangxi province in east China, troops helped 122,400 residents move from vulnerable low-lying areas, said the China News Service. In Hubei province in the centre, downpours two days ago triggered a landslide that left six people missing and blocked the Pingdu River, forcing 2,000 residents to flee in case a wall of water burst through the mud and debris. "Many small dams face major hazards," said China's Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, adding that "all areas must pay high attention to the safety of dams and hydro stations." In Zhejiang, an eastern province with many manufacturers, officials moved 120,000 residents as surging flood waters cut hundreds of roads and drove the Qiantang River to its highest flood peak since 1955, Xinhua news agency reported late on Thursday. Forecasters warned that in the coming days rains could bring fresh dangers, including in the southwest. "Tonight the rains will start from Sichuan province and Chongqing and move east," said meteorologist Li Xiaoquan, according to China's weather news website. The national forecaster also said heavy showers could hit Guangdong, the export-driven province next to Hong Kong. Floods and mudslides caused by the rain have killed at least 105 people and 65 are missing, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday. No official tally of the total number of deaths has been issued since then. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; editing by Tim Pearce)

Floods Leave 16 Dead, 4 Missing 
Floods of the Yellow River's biggest tributary of Weihe and Yangtze River's biggest tributary of Hanjiang have left 16 dead and four others missing, local officials said Wednesday. 
According to the Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Civil Affairs, the floods and mud slides they triggered have affected 4.61 million local residents, destroying 79,800 hectares of crops and pulling down 39,200 houses, with direct economic losses estimated at 1.94 billion yuan (US$239 million) in the province. 
The flood also damaged railway, highway, cable lines and irrigation infrastructures. 
A total of 359,200 people have been evacuated, the bureau said. 
Continued heavy rains from September 24 to October 2 caused the biggest flood in 10 years along the lower reaches of the Weihe River. 
The peak on Tuesday at Huaxian County's observation station along the Weihe River was 4,820 cubic meters per second. 
The Xiaolangdi Reservoir, a major water conservancy and irrigation facility on the Yellow River, has been used since Sunday to conserve floodwater. Industry insiders were optimistic about flood prevention for the lower reaches of the river. 
Weather forecasters said the rain will stop in southern parts of Shaanxi and western parts of central China's Henan Province, where the Yellow River passes through. 
Meanwhile, a lot of water in the Hanjiang River is adding to its middle and lower reaches so water levels keep rising, according to the Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters. 
Compared with previous floods, high water level volume has continued for longer, sources said. 
There was still the possibility of flooding along Hanjiang yesterday, according to Luo Qingquan, governor of Hubei Province. 
Luo urged localities there to keep a close eye on water levels and take necessary measures such as sending adequate manpower to patrol riverbanks during the autumn flood season, Xinhua reported yesterday. 
By 8 AM yesterday, the water levels monitored at Huangzhuang, Xiantao and Hanchuan hydrological stations rose, respectively, to 47.02, 33.75 and 28.2 meters, up by 1.02, 3.08 and 2.81 meters from Tuesday. 
The water level at the Xiangyang station was 67.19 meters, a drop of 0.07 meters from Tuesday, but still 0.19 meters above the danger line. And the water level at Yicheng station was 57.95 meters, 0.45 meters higher than the danger line. 
Hanjiang originates from Shaanxi Province. It flows southeastwardly through the central part of Hubei and joins the mighty Yangtze River at Wuhan, capital of Hubei.

BEIJING -- More than 5 million people have been displaced or otherwise affected by flooding in eastern China that is also pushing up food prices, state media reported Sunday. Torrential rains have left huge areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces under water, with more than 1 million acres (432,200 hectares) of farmland inundated, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Almost 1,000 businesses have been forced to suspend operations and 5.7 million people have had their lives disrupted, Xinhua said in a brief report. More than 7,000 homes collapsed or were otherwise damaged and direct financial damage was estimated at almost 6 billion yuan ($930 million). The downpour triggered a mudslide that buried houses and killed two people in Zhejiang's Changshan county, while two more were killed and two left missing by flooding in Hubei, Xinhua said. Flooding in eastern and southern China this month has left more than 170 people dead or missing. Roads and railways have been blocked, but aid supplies are arriving and the country's weather bureau says skies are expected to clear up Monday. Farmers quoted by Xinhua said the flooding was the worst in 20 years, reducing vegetable output by 20 percent and also causing shortages of fruits and grains. Prices for green vegetables were up 40 percent, Xinhua said, adding to an inflation rate of 5.5 percent, a three-year high. The increase in the consumer price index reported last week was in line with expectations but higher than April's 5.3 percent and March's 5.4 percent. The National Statistics Bureau said the main factor was an 11.7 percent jump in food prices. Higher food prices blamed on flooding were also reported in the eastern provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, Xinhua said.

 Just over a week ago there were many China bashers attacking the Three Gorges Dam as the cause for the 50 year drought that was affecting the same provinces as the flood region now. I shall love to hear from the same people how the 3GD is the cause of the floods now. 
This much should be evident. During the drought the 3GD had impounded water that was used to alleviate the drought. Without the dam there would not be any available water at all. As another commentator said (5 millions flooded out) everything in China is large numbers. That impounded water still barely made an impression on the parched lands as it affected several tens of thousands of square miles. 
Now we have this 50 year flood. Again without the 3GD to hold back the up river waters, had the rainstorms reached the upper reaches of the Yangtze, the floods downriver would have been even more devastating and affect an even bigger area. No the rains haven't reached there yet. But at least there is the very significant comfort that should it rain excessively there the runoff won't reach downriver unrestricted to add to the downriver miseries. Any overabundance of water can be be held back by the 3GD for a controlled release. Nothing much can be done to control the current downriver floods. With the 3GD it is assured that it won't get any worse.

 Keep in mind the population of China. They have 1.3 BILLION people. That's a billion more than the US. I don't think that number is outrageous at all. If anything I'd think the Chinese gov't would be inclined to be conservative.

 NATURAL DISASTERS? 
Electric cars, light bulbs and solar panels won't change anything as weather becomes extreme. It will worsen as China and India's 2,500,000,000 people move up the success ladder and demand more energy. 
Check all earth sciences and you will discover everything in the process of collapse due to over population of the planet including starvation, which has been going on for years, will pick up momentum. 
Dufar in the Sudan looks on the surface to be ethnic cleansing. Next time you look, look not at the starving people but the desert they live in that won't support the winners of this war. 
The Sahara is moving south at 20 miles a year. Soon they will all starve while in China, 37% of the ground water is not fit for human consumption and 34% of that is not fit for irrigation. 
Because people continue reproducing at a breakneck pace, They refuse to recognize that this planet cant sustain 7,300,000,000 devouring everything like a plague of locus in a wheat field. 
Extreme weather at this point is beyond human reach to repair it. Its picking up momentum as anything does when going down hill. We don't have 100's of years left in spite of what many people want to believe. 
The planet will continue to heat up for the next several thousand years since it is now running on automatic and regardless of what you hear not much can be done about it.

 Hope the people are found and returned to normal soon. If the region is a natural flood zone or new farming district, did the dams impact natural flow of water? Is the draining system updated to all connect and filter somewhere needed? To sump pump it out and put where lacking water would make sense,pooled and filtered. Could the crops be pulled from the water and transplanted to other regions or rooftops to grow? May the wasted infrared glasses around here be put to better use with the military on after storm units for trouble as this . Move the displaced into hotels nearby. Dievs to you. ~ Maija from Detroit

 My prayers go out for the people who are mostly poor in the agricultural areas. It will be interesting to see if China asks for help from its allies--not us---or if we can balance our trade deficit with China by sending them our produce at higher prices too, esp since they play monopoly with their yen to our dollar. I would like to see the Arabs, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and Mexico and the other countries that China is cozying up with me offer assistance.

 So if we use your logic, then why is gasoline so cheap in Saudi Arabia than it is in the US? We import crude so according to your logic, gasoline should be higher in Saudi Arabia.

China hits out at US deal on Taiwan F-16 fighters 
The US says it will upgrade Taiwan's existing fleet of F-16 fighters

Taiwan sweats on US arms sales Sino-US arms race? Country profile: Taiwan 
China has reacted angrily to a US deal to upgrade Taiwan's ageing fleet of US-built F-16 fighter planes. Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun said the $5.85bn (3.77bn) deal would "inevitably undermine bilateral relations", including military and security co-operation. He also summoned US Ambassador Gary Locke to protest against the deal. China traditionally reacts strongly to US military co-operation with Taiwan, which it considers its territory. Last year, when the US sold missiles and other hardware to Taiwan, China suspended military exchanges with the US. Correspondents say harsh words from China were expected, but it remains to be seen whether it takes any action to show its displeasure. Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Peking University, told the BBC he believed the Chinese reaction was aimed at a domestic audience. "China's grandstanding gesture - with very little action - is an attempt to avoid giving Chinese people the impression that despite the US's ongoing arm sales to Taiwan, the authorities are not responding in a robust manner," he said. Some future bilateral military exchanges could be postponed as a result, but the US-China relationship would not suffer long-term damage, he said. 'Must cancel' The US deal, revealed on Wednesday, falls short of what Taiwan had requested. 
Continue reading the main story Analysis 
Cindy Sui BBC News, Taipei 
The US decision, though widely expected, still came as a disappointment for Taiwan. Despite improved relations between Taiwan and China, Beijing continues to build up its military strength. And that build-up is widely seen as targeted at Taiwan, to warn the island it still claims as its province against becoming formally independent. Analysts say Washington has become reluctant to sell Taiwan big-ticket items in recent years, for fear of angering Beijing. The US needs China's co-operation on many issues - from trade, to North Korea and buying US bonds to deal with its debt. Washington faces a tough balancing act trying to juggle its relationship with China and its commitment to help its longtime ally Taiwan defend itself. 
 The announcement suggests the US will not now sell Taiwan a newer generation of F-16 fighters, as Taipei had hoped. It will instead upgrade its older-generation F-16 fleet. US officials said the F-16 A/B fighters will undergo a retrofit which will bring them up to the same standards as the more advanced C/D models. Mr Zhang called on Washington to "immediately cancel the wrong decision". China's defence ministry, meanwhile, said that the US action had "caused serious damage to Sino-US military relations". But Taiwanese officials appeared to welcome the news. "After the upgrade, the air force's combat capability will be advanced hugely," Taiwanese Defence Minister Kao Hua-chu said at a press conference in Taipei. The defence ministry said Taiwan remained under threat from China's military expansion. "Improving our defence capability is a crucial... measure to sustain regional security and stable development across the strait," it said in a statement. Taiwan also said it would continue its attempts to purchase more than 60 of the C/D planes, which are considered more of a match for China's latest war planes. Taipei said that decision was still pending in the US and urged officials to agree to it. Washington's decision will now pass to Congress for approval. Some analysts say the decision to approve an upgrade - rather than provide more advanced fighters - is designed to appease Beijing, which had warned that relations would suffer if the sale went ahead. In recent years China's military superiority over Taiwan has steadily increased, and the US is legally bound to help Taiwan defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979.

Flood of Yellow River Tributary Affects 1.6 Million People 
The flood of the Yellow River's biggest tributary, Weihe, already affected 1.6 million local residents and caused direct economic losses estimated at 490 million yuan (US$60.49 million) in Shaanxi Province, northwest China, sources said Tuesday. 
Continued heavy rains over the past week caused the biggest flood in ten years along the Weihe River, with crest passing Weinan City on mid-Tuesday measured at 4,820 cubic meters per second. 
The flood inundated an area of 180,000 hectares, washed down 12,000 houses and endangered another 25,449 in 11 counties and districts of Weinan City, which suffered most, city officials said. 
Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-Premier Hui Liangyu have urged great efforts to guarantee the life and property safety of the people. Both provincial Party chief Li Jianguo and Governor Chen Deming inspected the flood relief and prevention works along the Weihe River on Monday. 
So far, 315,000 people have been evacuated to safe places, and 30,000 others have been mobilized to ensure the safety of embankments.

Torrential rains batter parts of China, floods spread 
 16 Jun 2011 18:39

 // Reuters 
* Rains bring floods, landslides in centre, south * 120,000 evacuated in Zhejiang province in east 
By Chris Buckley BEIJING, June 16 (Reuters) - Pelting rain in parts of central and southern China has forced hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and prompted the government to demand safety checks on vulnerable dams, news reports said on Thursday. The torrential rains have ended a drought in many areas, but now threaten the Yangtze River basin and nearby provinces with floods and mudslides that have killed at least 105 people. In Jiangxi province in east China, troops helped 122,400 residents move from vulnerable low-lying areas, said the China News Service. In Hubei province in the centre, downpours two days ago triggered a landslide that left six people missing and blocked the Pingdu River, forcing 2,000 residents to flee in case a wall of water burst through the mud and debris. "Many small dams face major hazards," said China's Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, adding that "all areas must pay high attention to the safety of dams and hydro stations." In Zhejiang, an eastern province with many manufacturers, officials moved 120,000 residents as surging flood waters cut hundreds of roads and drove the Qiantang River to its highest flood peak since 1955, Xinhua news agency reported late on Thursday. Forecasters warned that in the coming days rains could bring fresh dangers, including in the southwest. "Tonight the rains will start from Sichuan province and Chongqing and move east," said meteorologist Li Xiaoquan, according to China's weather news website. The national forecaster also said heavy showers could hit Guangdong, the export-driven province next to Hong Kong. Floods and mudslides caused by the rain have killed at least 105 people and 65 are missing, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday. No official tally of the total number of deaths has been issued since then. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; editing by Tim Pearce)

13,000 People Evacuated in Hubei Province 
About 13,000 people affected by a flood in central China's Hubei Province have moved to safe places, according to a source of the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters on Monday. A heavy rain has been hitting the Danjiangkou Reservoir along the upper reaches of the Hanjiang River, flooding some counties and cutting off several roads in the city of Shiyan since Thursday. The water level of the reservoir rose to 154.67 meters at 8AM Monday, the source said. Contingency measures are underway to control the autumn flood in the Hanjiang River, one of the major tributaries of the Yangtze River, said Cai Qihua, deputy director of the flood control headquarters of Yangtze. Dams along the middle and lower reaches of the Hanjiang River are kept under careful examination and detailed recording, and weather changes are also under close watch, Cai said. Vice governor of Hubei Province Liu Youfan ordered relevant departments to investigate the flood situation, guide the flood-relief work and evacuate people concerned in time. Weather forecast showed the upper reaches of the Hanjiang River will still face heavy rain in the coming two days, which will make the flood-control work more complicated. "The flood is still under control though it seems still severe," Cai said.(Xinhua News Agency October 4, 2005)

Heavy Rainstorm Drenches Jinan 
Jinan, capital city of east China's Shandong Province, was drenched with a record-breaking rainfall since Sunday, which was the biggest one in the autumn during the past 54 years, said the city meteorologic observatory Tuesday. The unremitting rain, with a precipitation of more than 170 mm, set a new record since the city established its weather records in1951. The observatory said it was very rare to see a rainfall exceeding 100 mm in the autumn in Jinan. The only exception occurred in the autumn of 1964, when the precipitation reached 102.3 mm. Experts attributed the heavy rainfall to the joint effects by subtropical high air pressures and currents of warm air from the southwest Pacific. Local government said no casualty had been reported as of Tuesday afternoon but the heavy rain caused traffic jams on the city's main roads and it also seriously challenged the city's drainage system. The heaviest rainfall that struck Jinan occurred in 1994's summer with a precipitation of 188 mm and the observatory said this is the second largest one on the city's weather record.

Typhoon Leaves 9 Dead, 1 Missing in Zhejiang 
Nine people were killed and one left missing in the eastern province of Zhejiang after this year's fifteenth typhoon hit yesterday, local government sources said on Monday. Named Khanun, the Thai word for jackfruit, the typhoon forced the provincial government to call 37,625 ships back to harbor. Total economic losses have been estimated at 6.89 billion yuan (US$849 million), according to officials from the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters. As of 6:00 AM today, Khanun battered four cities, 29 counties and 357 towns in the province, affecting 5.11 million people. Strong winds and rainstorms destroyed 7,468 houses and damaged water facilities and cropland, said the headquarters. Meteorologists described it as the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, bringing force 12 gales over eight hours, and the province reported rainfall of over 400 mm at three observation stations. The provincial government has already evacuated more than one million people and there have been blackouts in some parts. The provincial observatory forecast that the center of the typhoon, which has been moving northwestward at 25 km per hour, was expected to bore into neighboring Jiangsu Province early today. The municipality of Shanghai has also evacuated 100,000 people and its observatory upgraded its typhoon emergency warning from yellow to red. From 6 to 8 PM yesterday, 116 flights were suspended in Shanghai's Pudong and Hongqiao airports, and today all its middle schools, primary schools and kindergartens were closed for the first time as strong torrential rains were expected. As for Anhui, another neighboring province, downpours were expected in some parts, and flood and landslide warnings issued for mountainous and river areas. Rainfall was forecast to continue till Wednesday.

Torrential rains batter parts of China, floods spread

* Rains bring floods, landslides in centre, south * 120,000 evacuated in Zhejiang province in east 
By Chris Buckley BEIJING, June 16 (Reuters) - Pelting rain in parts of central and southern China has forced hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and prompted the government to demand safety checks on vulnerable dams, news reports said on Thursday. The torrential rains have ended a drought in many areas, but now threaten the Yangtze River basin and nearby provinces with floods and mudslides that have killed at least 105 people. In Jiangxi province in east China, troops helped 122,400 residents move from vulnerable low-lying areas, said the China News Service. In Hubei province in the centre, downpours two days ago triggered a landslide that left six people missing and blocked the Pingdu River, forcing 2,000 residents to flee in case a wall of water burst through the mud and debris. "Many small dams face major hazards," said China's Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, adding that "all areas must pay high attention to the safety of dams and hydro stations." In Zhejiang, an eastern province with many manufacturers, officials moved 120,000 residents as surging flood waters cut hundreds of roads and drove the Qiantang River to its highest flood peak since 1955, Xinhua news agency reported late on Thursday. Forecasters warned that in the coming days rains could bring fresh dangers, including in the southwest. "Tonight the rains will start from Sichuan province and Chongqing and move east," said meteorologist Li Xiaoquan, according to China's weather news website. The national forecaster also said heavy showers could hit Guangdong, the export-driven province next to Hong Kong. Floods and mudslides caused by the rain have killed at least 105 people and 65 are missing, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday. No official tally of the total number of deaths has been issued since then. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; editing by Tim Pearce)

Anti-flood Spur on Both Banks of Shenzhen 
Improvement works, being carried out by teams from Hong Kong and Guangdong, will greatly ease the flooding problem on both sides of the Shenzhen River when it is completed next year. SAR Director of Drainage Services Lai Fuk-kan said this to visiting Shenzhen Mayor Xu Zongheng-- who was in Hong Kong for a three-day visit-- during a tour of the Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works yesterday. Lai said his department had been working closely with Shenzhen authorities on the improvement works of Shenzhen River regulation project in recent years. He expected that flooding on both sides of the river would be "substantially alleviated" after completion of the third stage of the regulation project. Moving on to discuss the sewage issue, Lai said: "We are dedicated to implementing the Harbor Area Treatment Scheme Stage Two and improving the sewerage systems in other areas, to protect the water quality of the harbor and other surrounding waters." "By early next year, Hong Kong's first tertiary sewage treatment works at Ngong Ping, Lantau, will be fully operational and the treated effluent from the plant will be used as flushing water in nearby public toilets as a pilot scheme for the development of reclaimed water." Joining the tour were the head of Hong Kong Guangdong Cooperation Coordination Unit Ho Kin-wah; and Director of Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Guangdong Leung Pak-yan. The Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works is now treating some 1.4 million cubic meters per day, half of the sewage generated by the Hong Kong population. Xu and other members of the Shenzhen government visited Cyberport yesterday morning. Led by the Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology John Tsang, the Shenzhen delegation toured around various facilities at Cyberport, including the Hong Kong Wireless Development Centre, the Digital Media Center and an advanced digital entertainment company. Xu will visit the Hong Kong Planning and Infrastructure Exhibition Gallery in Central today. (China Daily September 7, 2005)

More than one million evacuated in China floods Posted: 17 June 2011 1834 hrs 
Photos of 
BEIJING - More than one million people in China have been evacuated following downpours that have raised water levels in rivers to critical highs, and triggered floods and landslides, the government said on Friday.The summer rains have left at least 168 people dead or missing so far, and weather authorities warned on Friday that flood-hit areas across the southern half of China would experience a fresh round of heavy rainfall."These areas must strengthen their prevention of geological disasters," the National Meteorological Centre said.Authorities have evacuated more than one million people in eight provinces, regions and municipalities since June 9, the civil affairs ministry said late Thursday.One waterway in the eastern province of Zhejiang has risen to its highest levels in 56 years, while other rivers across southern China have burst their banks, the nation's flood control headquarters added.Some of the areas being pounded by rain - such as Hubei and Hunan provinces - were only recently in the thralls of a severe drought, which has in some cases made the situation worse.A week ago, one landslide blasted through villages in Hunan before dawn, killing at least 19 people and leaving another eight missing. One village saw most of its houses buried by mud, state media reported.Experts sent to investigate said the mudslide was triggered by the heaviest rain in the area in 300 years, adding the ground was drier than usual because of the drought, making it easier for downpours to sweep away sand and rocks.China is hit by heavy summer rainfalls every year. In 2010, torrential downpours across large swathes of the country triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade, leaving more than 4,300 people dead or missing.One devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu killed 1,500 people in August.- AFP/al

Typhoon Talim Leaves 95 Dead, 30 Missing 
The death toll from Typhoon Talim in China climbed to 95 on Monday while 30 people are missing, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs on Monday. Talim hit Fujian Province on September 1 and has so far caused direct economic losses of approximately 12.19 billion yuan (about US$1.5 billion). The typhoon brought torrential rainfall that led to severe landslides and mudflows in Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces in east China and Hubei in central China, the ministry said. In Anhui, one of the provinces most badly affected, 59 people have been reported dead and 12 others missing. Economic loss there has reached 2.75 billion yuan (US$335 million). The State Council has allocated 182 million yuan (US$22.2 million) for relief work in the affected areas. The fund, jointly raised by ministries of finance, water resources, civil affairs and agriculture, includes 94 million yuan for essentials like food and clean drinking water, and 88 million yuan for disaster relief. The State Council also warned that water levels in the Huaihe River, some branches of the Yangtze River and many reservoirs are still high, and mountain torrents, mudflows and landslides might happen at any time in some areas. Local governments have been ordered to stay alert and bolster flood control measures.

Typhoon Talim Claims 31 Lives in Anhui 
Torrential rains and flooding caused by Typhoon Talim have claimed at least 31 lives and left 12 others missing in Anhui Province over the past three days, a provincial official said Saturday. 
Flood waters and heavy flows of mud and rock also destroyed infrastructure facilities and flattened homes in the Dabie Mountain area of the province. 
Preliminary investigation shows that in Yuexi and Jinzhai, two worst-hit counties, about 400,000 people suffered from the disasters and 46,000 hectares of cropland were affected. 
The Anhui provincial government has sent two work teams for the rescue and disaster relief work. 
Death toll in the disaster of the typhoon Talim has risen to 14 in Wenzhou City, east China's Zhejiang Province, local government said Friday night. Other nine people are still missing in a series of thunderstorms, landsides and cave-ins caused by Talim, said sources from the local Headquarters of Flood Control and Drought Relief. 
Talim pounded Putian in Fujian Province, Zhejiang's close neighbor, at 2:30pm on Thursday, packing gusts at a maximum speed of 126 kilometers per hour. 
According to preliminary statistics, a total of 2.22 million people in 335 townships of 18 counties have been affected in cities of Wenzhou and Lishui, both located in southern part of Zhejiang. Meanwhile, 11,789 houses were pulled down.

Fugitive Crocodiles at Mercy of Elements 
The city of Benxi, 800 kilometers northeast of Beijing was hit by heavy rains early last week. A private crocodile farm near the Taizi River flooded on August 13 as a result and 29 Siamese crocodiles took advantage of the heightened water levels to make good their escape. 
In the last 10 days, 15 of them have been recaptured and returned to the farm. One was killed. But 13 of them are still at large. 
The Benxi Shuidong Crocodile Park founded in 2000 is a private zoo. It has a total of 31 reptiles with the biggest weighing more than 300 kilograms. 
Mai Yingpei, manager of the park, said his crocodiles had never run away before. 
"They are doomed if we don't find them as soon as possible because the autumn cold is drawing near," Mai said. 
Siamese crocodiles live primarily in tropical and sub-tropical regions, according to experts from the Benxi Wildlife Protection Bureau. 
The ideal temperature for these reptiles is above 17 degrees Celsius. The current water temperature in the Taizi River, however, is between 12 and 14 degrees, and it is getting colder. 
To make matters worse, the crocodiles might become more aggressive if they don't find enough food in the wild, according to a keeper at the farm. 
The park has set up a hotline for people to report crocodile sightings. 
"Local police forces have been put on alert and will act on any promising leads, " Wang Yuwei, a local senior police officer, said.

Flooding Kills 12 in Central China Province 
Twelve people were killed and another 18 went missing in a major flooding and landslide caused by powerful rainstorms in central China's Hubei Province. Sources with the civil affairs bureau of the province said that 17 counties in Shiyan, Xiangfan and Suizhou cities of the province were hit by heavy rainstorms from Sunday to Monday, which led to a serious flooding and landslide. The flooding and landslide also leveled civilian houses and caused failures in transportation, telecommunications and power supply in some areas, said the sources, adding that Party and government authorities of the province have called for all-out rescue and relief efforts. In addition to launching a quick response mechanism and introducing a 24-hour on-duty system, the provincial civil affairs bureau dispatched officials to major areas hit by the disaster to give guidance in the relief operation, and also allotted 3.9 million yuan (about US$480,888) to finance the rescue efforts in those afflicted areas. Governments in the affected counties and cities also earmarked over 5 million yuan (about US$616,523) for the local relief efforts. Relief operation was carried out in a swift and orderly manner and residents from the areas hit by the disaster have been properly accommodated, according to local sources.(Xinhua News Agency August 19, 2005)

Three Killed in Shaanxi Heavy Rainstorms 
Unremitted heavy rainstorms left three dead and three others missing in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, sources with the local flood control department said Thursday. The source said 98 counties in Shaanxi have been hit by rainstorms since Sunday. The rainstorms trigger floods, mountain torrents and mud-rock flow in the counties of Zhenping, Pingli, Baihe, Shangnan and Zuoshui, affecting more than 180,000 people. The disasters toppled more than 600 houses and destroyed about 50,000 mu (about 3333 hectares) of farmland, causing a direct economic loss of nearly 100 million yuan (about US$12.2 million). The local meteorological station said the rainstorms will not come to a halt until Monday. Civil affairs departments of all levels in Shaanxi are in full swing of relocating the homeless.

Disaster-relief Work Underway in Liaoning 
Emergency disaster relief work is underway in northeast China's Liaoning Province after massive flooding. The provincial government has allocated 4.5 million yuan (about US$555,000) for emergency disaster relief. The department of civil affairs relocated 190,000 homeless people and workers are now in the region to organize the disaster relief work. Zhou Zhimin is the deputy head of the department. "After the flood recedes, we will focus on house construction. We will try our best to ensure afflicted people can live in new houses by the beginning of winter." Torrential rainstorms and floods in the province since Friday killed ten people, injured 46 and left 35 others missing. The floods hit 20 counties of seven cities in Liaoning, affecting 1.4 million people. More than 65,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 120,000 hectares of farmland are damaged.

China floods kill 44 in drought-hit provinces 
Fri, Jun 10 2011 BEIJING (Reuters) - Torrential rain in two drought-stricken central China provinces triggered landslides and brought down houses, killing at least 44 people and leaving 33 missing, state media said on Friday. The number of people evacuated from the city of Xianning in Hubei province rose to 100,000 by Friday evening, with thousands still stranded, official news agency Xinhua said. Fierce downpours started on Thursday evening, causing landslides and destroying river embankments in parts of the city. Flood waters reached depths of more than 2 meters (6.5 ft) and 20 people were killed. In the cities of Linxiang and Yueyang in nearby Hunan province, the death toll rose to 19 by late Friday, with another 28 still missing, Xinhua said. The two provinces were among the worst hit by a severe drought in recent months that affected millions of hectares of farmland in central and southern China along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river. Over the weekend, a tropical storm is forecast to hit two other provinces, Xinhua said. The China Meteorological Administration said in a statement on its website (www.cma.gov.cn) that the storm, Sarika, is expected to make landfall near the city of Shantou in southeast China's Guangdong province then head north toward Fujian. The storm may also affect shipping in the key Taiwan Strait, Xinhua said. The drought damaged crops and exacerbated a power shortage by cutting power generation from dams, adding a slight bump to near three-year high consumer inflation. The drought ended last weekend with the rains that have brought deadly floods, so far killing about 100 people in 12 provinces. In eastern Jiangxi province, 1,200 people were stranded by floods after heavy rain fell on the northern part of the province on Thursday, China News Service said in a separate report.

Rescuers Find Bodies of 2 Villagers Swept away by Flood in Harbin 
Rescuers have found the bodies of the two villagers who went missing Tuesday in a rainstorm-inflicted flood along the Piaohe River in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. A spokesman for the local government said the bodies of Feng Yong and his cousin Feng Ce were found at 5:00 AM Wednesday in paddy field close to their family's fishpond. The cousins, both peasant farmers from Hulan District in Harbin, went missing as the flood peak in Piaohe River began rushing to the lower reaches at about 2:00 PM Tuesday. They were on their way home after fencing the fishpond with nets to protect the fishes from being washed away. Piaohe is a small river rarely prone to flood, but heavy rainstorm in its upper reaches since Monday night formed a flood peak rushing to the lower reaches in a short time(Xinhua News Agency August 17, 2005)

Rainstorm Hits NE China City, 2 Missing 
Two villagers were said missing in a rainstorm-inflicted flooding along a river in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, Tuesday afternoon, local government sources said. The two farmers of Hulan District of Harbin went missing as the flood peak in the Piaohe River began rushing to the lower reaches at about 2 PM Tuesday. Qi Hongbao, an official with the information office of the Hulan District government, said that Piaohe is a small river and normally has a small amount of current. Rainstorm early Tuesday morning formed a flood peak in the river that rushed to the lower reaches of the river in a short period of time. Two farmers who were working by the river side were washed away, Qi said. Search for the two missing farmers was still continuing. In another development, torrential rainstorms and ensuing floods in northeast China's Liaoning Province since Friday killed ten people, injured 46 and left 35 others missing, according to sources with the provincial department of civil affairs Monday. The floods hit 20 counties of seven cities in Liaoning, affecting 1.44 million people. The precipitation in the city of Fushun amounted to 150 mm and it reached 174 mm in Tieling City. A total of 6,531 homes were destroyed and 118,000 hectares of farmland were left fruitless. The provincial government has allocated 4.5 million yuan (about US$544,000) for emergency disaster relief. The department of civil affairs relocated 188,000 homeless people and sent three working teams to the flood-hit areas to organize the disaster relief work. (Xinhua News Agency August 17, 2005)

Country Braces for More Rainfall 
Areas throughout the country, already reeling from cyclones, downpours, floods and ensuing disasters, are in for further punishment with more rain forecast this week. The National Meteorological Center yesterday issued warnings of torrential rains in many provinces and municipalities across north, northeast, central, east and southwest China. "Heavy rains and rainstorms will pound parts of Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin provinces in northeast China, and Hebei Province, Beijing and Tianjin in north China," it warned. Affected by Sanvu, the year's 10th typhoon, and the summer monsoon, rainstorms will sweep south, east, central and southwest China including the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, Henan, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces and Chongqing Municipality from today. Three died and three went missing in Hubei's Mudanjiang. Weather forecasters have urged authorities in mountainous areas to prepare for disasters, such as mud-rock flows and landslides. At least 10 people were killed by floods with 35 still missing yesterday in Liaoning, a source with the Ministry of Civil Affairs said. Floods triggered by heavy rains over the past week hit 31 counties and cities in the province and affected more than 2.3 million people with 341,000 evacuated, he said. The disaster destroyed about 30,000 houses with direct economic losses amounting to 2.31 billion yuan (US$284 million). Local governments have earmarked 40 million yuan (US$4.9 million) for the rescue and relief operation, he added. Heavy rains, Liaoning's worst in 10 years, have swelled the Liaohe, Hunhe, and Taize rivers and triggered the highest water levels in reservoirs for 20 years, according to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters. "Fortunately, the damage has been mitigated as all the reservoirs were put into full operation to hold or regulate water from the swollen rivers," Zhang Zhitong, an official from the headquarters said.

China floods kill 52 people, more rain forecast in south

BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Floods have killed 52 people and left 32 missing in China since the flood season started in June, a senior official said Wednesday, warning of more heavy rains. Heavy rains have inundated parts of 12 provinces in central and southern China and affected 4.81 million people so far since the flood season arrived, Shu Qingpeng, deputy head of the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, told a Wednesday press conference. In the worst-hit southwestern province of Guizhou, floods have killed 21 people and left 32 missing in the past few days, forcing nearly 100,000 people to evacuate. More than 3,000 rescuers are working to locate the missing and fight the floods in the province's Wangmo County, where all the deaths and most of the missing were reported after downpours lashed the county Monday morning. The county recorded a maximum one-hour precipitation of 122.5 millimeters, the most in 200 years, Shu said. More than 45,000 people in Wangmo have been evacuated from their homes to escape the rising water. Food, coats, tents and quilts have been dispatched to the county. Chen Mingming, Party chief of the Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which administers Wangmo, vowed Wednesday to spare no efforts to find the missing and ensure basic living for the evacuees. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Ministry of Civil Affairs on Wednesday allocated 35 million yuan (5.39 million U.S. dollars) to help flood relief. The MOF said in a statement on its website that the fund would be used to help relocate evacuees, provide temporary living assistance, reconstruct destroyed buildings and offer pensions to relatives of those who perished in the floods. Floods in the neighboring province of Jiangxi also forced more than 13,600 people to flee their homes. Since June, floods have destroyed 7,462 houses and submerged 255,000 hectares of farmland in China, incurring direct economic losses of 4.92 billion yuan (760 million U.S. dollars), Shu said. Heavy rainfalls have drenched the previously parched lower and middle parts of the Yangtze River basin, increasing water of rivers to alert levels in the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan and Guizhou. According to Shu, the rain has put an end to the persistent drought in the provinces of Jiangxi, Guizhou and Zhejiang. The drought in Hubei and Anhui has also been eased, but in the nearby province of Jiangsu, more rains are needed to provide relief. Thunder showers also hit the country's north Tuesday night. Two people were killed and one was injured by lightning in Beijing, where more than 1,000 thunder strikes were recorded late Tuesday and early Wednesday. In the northern province of Hebei, a wall collapsed in a rainstorm Tuesday evening, killing one passerby and wounding six others. According to Shu, southern China will be hit by more rain over the coming few days. He asked local authorities to closely monitor rainfall and water levels and warned of more floods, landslides and mountain torrents.

Recent Flood In China | China declares day of mourning for flood victims - Los Angeles TimesAdvertisementYOU ARE HERE: LAT HomeCollectionsChinese OfficialsChina declares day of mourning for flood victimsAs the nation grieves for 1,200 people killed in recent flooding and landslides, more rain is forecast.August 14, 2010|By John M. Glionna | Los Angeles Times Staff WriterReporting from Beijing Chinese officials declared Sunday a national day of mourning to remember the more than 1,200 people killed in recent flooding, which still held parts of the country in its grip. More rain was forecast for remote Gansu province, where the swollen Bailong River was expected once again to overflow its banks, causing new trauma for survivors of the punishing weather that first struck Aug. 7. 
 For days, reports of continued death and devastation have hit China hard, provoking an outpouring of sympathy for the stricken. The state-run New China News Agency on Saturday continued its run of heart-wrenching photographs, including rescuers pulling bodies from the mud, boats passing the roofs of submerged houses and a father clutching strands of his dead daughter's hair. As late as Thursday, residents in the far northwestern region reported hearing cries for help from buildings in areas overwhelmed by mudslides, the news agency reported. "We will seize every chance to find survivors, but it is also important to ensure the safety of rescuers," one official said. The thick mud was impeding efforts to remove the dead in hardest-hit Zhouqu County, where scores of multistory buildings were still threatened with collapse, officials said. Many bodies, shrouded in blankets, were left on streets alongside debris from the disaster. Officials reported numerous cases of dysentery and stressed the importance of clean drinking water in flooded areas. Soldiers were in the area to spread health tips in an effort to prevent an epidemic, officials said. This year has seen the worst floods nationwide in a decade. Deluges have killed more than 2,000 people since the beginning of 2010. Officials in Beijing said flags nationwide and at overseas embassies and consulates would be flown at half-staff Sunday to honor the dead. Such large-scale national displays of mourning are rare in China. john.glionna@latimes.com

BEIJING Floods triggered by torrential rain in southern and central China have killed 52 people and forced more than 100,000 to flee their homes, state media reported Wednesday.Another 32 people were missing in the floods which have inundated parts of 12 provinces since the start of June, Shu Qingpeng, deputy head of the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, told a conference, Xinhua news agency said.The southwestern province of Guizhou was the hardest hit, with 21 dead, more than 30 missing and some 100,000 evacuated, Xinhua said in a separate report citing the ministry of finance.Guizhou's Wangmo county recorded 122.5 millimetres (4.8 inches) of rainfall in one hour, the most in 200 years, Shu said.The floods across China have destroyed nearly 7,500 houses and submerged 255,000 hectares (630,000 acres) of farmland, causing direct losses of 4.92 billion yuan ($760 million), he said.Shu warned local authorities to monitor rainfall and water levels as further heavy rains are expected to hit many parts of the country over the next few days.In the province of Hunan, which neighbours Guizhou, around 16,000 people were evacuated in Loudi city during rainstorms, Xinhua reported on Monday.The province has recently been hit by a severe drought, and the recent rains had helped alleviate the situation.China suffers from serious summer rainfalls every year. In 2010, torrential downpours across large swathes of the country triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade.More than 4,300 people died or went missing in China last year in landslides or floods, including 1,500 people who were killed in one devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu in August.China's flood control and drought relief headquarters said Monday that the recent downpours had helped ease a severe drought along the Yangtze river, but warned that more than two million people still faced water shortages.Weather authorities warned that rainfall this month, while relieving drought-hit areas, would also trigger floods in other parts of the country, Xinhua reported.

June 21, 2011|From Helena Hong, CNNA man rides a bicycle through flood water in Lanxi, east China's Zhejiang province on June 20, 2011.At least 175 people have died from flooding this month in southern and eastern China, the country's Ministry of Civil Affairs said Monday.Another 86 people are missing from the flooding that began with rainfall on June 3. The ministry said 13 provinces have been affected, more than 1.6 million people have been evacuated, and the direct economic losses has reached 35.02 billion yuan ($5.4 billion).The flooding has destroyed at least 8,400 houses in Zhejiang province alone, a provincial agency said.Advertisement 
More than 4.4 million have been affected by the flooding in Zhejiang as of Monday, according to the Zhejiang Flood Control Office. About 292,000 have been evacuated, according to the agency's website.The direct economic loss in Zhejiang has reached 7.69 billion yuan ($1.18 billion), the agency said.Zhao Fayuan, director of the Zhejiang Flood Control Office, said the areas around the Qiantang and Dongtiao rivers have been the most severely affected.In Zhoushan, about 155 kilometers (95 miles) southeast of Shanghai, massive pools of water submerged homes in a section of the city on Tuesday, leaving only the tops of power poles as clues of the community underneath.Residents fear waters may not recede for another week.At least 171,000 hectares (422,550 acres) of crops have been destroyed by flooding, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing data from local officials. A Zhejiang official said more than 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) of dikes were in danger of overflowing near Lanxi city, according to Xinhua.The southern province of Jiangxi is grappling with the worst flooding on record there. At least 40,000 people have been evacuated from flooding over the weekend."The farmlands are severely affected by the flood," Qiu Qiyong of the Jiangxi Flood Control and Drought Relief Office said Monday. He said the economic loss over two days reached 0.836 billion yuan ($129 million).Residents in Jiangxi got a bit of a respite Monday, as rainfall stopped and water levels decreased. Some of those evacuated were able to return to their homes.Hubei province -- where the Three Gorges Dam is located -- has suffered significant flooding, according to Xinhua. And the rains caused water levels in dozens of reservoirs in neighboring Hunan province "to exceed alarming levels," the news agency said.The flooding ended the worst drought to hit southern China in 50 years.It came a month after the Chinese government acknowledged that Three Gorges Dam -- the world's largest hydropower plant -- was having "urgent problems" and warned of environmental, construction and migration "disasters."The dam was originally touted for its ability to control the impact of flooding that threatens the Yangtze River Delta each summer.But more than 1,000 towns and villages were flooded during the digging and construction of the dam's giant concrete barrier. And landslides and pollution have plagued the areas near the dam since it was built.

Beginning of Story Content Rain-triggered floods in southwestern China have killed 14 people and left 53 others missing while destroying roads, bridges and thousands of homes, officials said Tuesday. The 14 deaths were reported in Guizhou province's Wangmo county, where 52 people were reported missing, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported, citing the provincial civil affairs authority. Another person was missing in the province's Luodian county. Acid spill contaminates Hangzhou water supply A toxic chemical spilled into a river that supplies drinking water to the scenic city of Hangzhou in eastern China, knocking out supplies to more than half a million people and creating a run on bottled water. A tanker truck carrying 20 tonness of carbolic acid overturned late Saturday night. The chemical, also known as phenol, was washed by rain into the Xin'an River about 150 kilometres southwest of Hangzhou, the city said in a report on its website. The city said an emergency worker died, but did not say how. It said authorities temporarily shut down water plants and released extra water from nearby dams to dilute the spill, which affected the water supplies of at least 552,000 people in Hangzhou's suburbs. The concentration of carbolic acid near the accident site remained more than 900 times the safe drinking level as of late Monday, the report said. 
Some 45,000 residents in worst-hit Wangmo county have been evacuated since flood waters inundated the area Monday, said Tang Quanshu of the county's flood prevention office. She said another 3,000 people were still stranded. Meanwhile, the waters toppled 300 houses and left 2,400 submerged, while 5,500 hectares of farmland were under water, Tang said. Xinhua, citing county flood officials, reported that the flooding disrupted power and water supplies and telecommunications services in several towns in Wangmo county, which has a population of eight million. It said the floods destroyed roads and bridges and washed away more than 500 vehicles. About 6,000 students from four schools had to stay at home Tuesday, as their schools were rendered inaccessible by water, the county's education chief Yan Tie said according to Xinhua. Cao Zeying, principal of the county's No. 2 Primary School, said that flooding destroyed the school's 300-metre-long enclosure and submerged several classrooms, with waters on campus 1.6 metres deep on Monday. The provincial civil affairs bureau said floods have hit 14 cities and counties in Guizhou province since June 3, affecting 400,000 people, according to Xinhua. Rain is forecast through Thursday in most of the province. The Associated Press, 2011 Accessibility Links

Torrential rains batter parts of China, floods spread

* Rains bring floods, landslides in centre, south * 120,000 evacuated in Zhejiang province in east 
By Chris Buckley BEIJING, June 16 (Reuters) - Pelting rain in parts of central and southern China has forced hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and prompted the government to demand safety checks on vulnerable dams, news reports said on Thursday. The torrential rains have ended a drought in many areas, but now threaten the Yangtze River basin and nearby provinces with floods and mudslides that have killed at least 105 people. In Jiangxi province in east China, troops helped 122,400 residents move from vulnerable low-lying areas, said the China News Service. In Hubei province in the centre, downpours two days ago triggered a landslide that left six people missing and blocked the Pingdu River, forcing 2,000 residents to flee in case a wall of water burst through the mud and debris. "Many small dams face major hazards," said China's Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, adding that "all areas must pay high attention to the safety of dams and hydro stations." In Zhejiang, an eastern province with many manufacturers, officials moved 120,000 residents as surging flood waters cut hundreds of roads and drove the Qiantang River to its highest flood peak since 1955, Xinhua news agency reported late on Thursday. Forecasters warned that in the coming days rains could bring fresh dangers, including in the southwest. "Tonight the rains will start from Sichuan province and Chongqing and move east," said meteorologist Li Xiaoquan, according to China's weather news website. The national forecaster also said heavy showers could hit Guangdong, the export-driven province next to Hong Kong. Floods and mudslides caused by the rain have killed at least 105 people and 65 are missing, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday. No official tally of the total number of deaths has been issued since then. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; editing by Tim Pearce)

30 killed, dozens missing in China floodsMon Sep 19, 2011 3:2PMShare | Email | PrintParamilitary policemen evacuate stranded residents in flood-hit Bazhong, Sichuan province, September 18, 2011.At least 30 people have been killed and dozens of others have gone missing after torrential rains and flooding in north and southwest China that forced thousands to leave their homes. Heavy rain that started on Friday has swamped huge portions of southwestern province of Sichuan, killing 13 people and leaving 10 others missing. Authorities of cities of Dazhou and Guang'an in Sichuan have ordered the evacuation of nearly 600,000, Xinhua reported on Monday. The toll from the massive rain-triggered landslide in the province of Shaanxi, north of Sichuan, has risen to at least 17 dead and 18 missing. Rain has stopped in Shaanxi and rescue efforts are continuing, officials from Shaanxi's capital city of Xi'an said. Floods have left 57 people dead and 29 others missing in Henan, Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces and forced the evacuation of more than 1.2 million people, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs said in a statement on Monday. The heavy rains that have destroyed 50,800 hectares of crops and damaged 129,000 houses across the three provinces have cost the country's economy about $2.7 billion, the ministry said.

More than one million evacuated in China floods Posted: 17 June 2011 1834 hrs 
Photos of 
BEIJING - More than one million people in China have been evacuated following downpours that have raised water levels in rivers to critical highs, and triggered floods and landslides, the government said on Friday.The summer rains have left at least 168 people dead or missing so far, and weather authorities warned on Friday that flood-hit areas across the southern half of China would experience a fresh round of heavy rainfall."These areas must strengthen their prevention of geological disasters," the National Meteorological Centre said.Authorities have evacuated more than one million people in eight provinces, regions and municipalities since June 9, the civil affairs ministry said late Thursday.One waterway in the eastern province of Zhejiang has risen to its highest levels in 56 years, while other rivers across southern China have burst their banks, the nation's flood control headquarters added.Some of the areas being pounded by rain - such as Hubei and Hunan provinces - were only recently in the thralls of a severe drought, which has in some cases made the situation worse.A week ago, one landslide blasted through villages in Hunan before dawn, killing at least 19 people and leaving another eight missing. One village saw most of its houses buried by mud, state media reported.Experts sent to investigate said the mudslide was triggered by the heaviest rain in the area in 300 years, adding the ground was drier than usual because of the drought, making it easier for downpours to sweep away sand and rocks.China is hit by heavy summer rainfalls every year. In 2010, torrential downpours across large swathes of the country triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade, leaving more than 4,300 people dead or missing.One devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu killed 1,500 people in August.- AFP/al

Puyehue volcano erupted for the first time in half a century on June 4, 2011, prompting evacuations for 3,500 people as it sent a cloud of ash that reached Argentina. The National Service of Geology and Mining said the explosion that sparked the eruption also produced a column of gas 10 kilometers (six miles) high, hours after warning of strong seismic activity in the area.

Photo: Reuters/Darley Wong.RelatedChina goes to highest disaster alert as 25 die in continuing torrential rain | 18/06/2011Heavy rains and floods kill 100 people in China | 13/06/2011Devastation as Chinese floods follow drought | 08/06/2011Flood, drought and pollution: it's a dam mess | 28/05/2011Torrential rain across southern and eastern China which has killed more than 100 people and triggered the evacuation of half a million has left large areas of farmland devastated as food prices surge, state media said today.Weeks of rainstorms in the stricken province of Zhejiang in the Yangtze delta have caused nearly 5 billion yuan ($772 million) of damage, reducing vegetable production by 20 percent and pushing prices in the provincial capital of Hangzhou up by as much as 40 per cent, Xinhua said.China is hit by flooding and drought every year.The rain is expected to continue for the next two days, stretching from the financial hub of Shanghai in the east to rural Yunnan on China's southwestern border.Villagers on the outskirts of the city of Zhuji in Zhejiang returned to their homes today as flood waters began to recede."Right now, I am just clearing up the things in my store," said 37-year-old shop owner Peng Gao. "It's not about whether the floods will come again. If we don't clear the things, we will not be able to use them again."Two towns were flooded and thousands were evacuated following the breach of two dykes in Zhuji on Thursday.China has mobilised troops across the region to rescue stricken farmers and distribute food, but some villagers said the local government could have done more to prevent the flooding."When it first started, the breach [in the flood protection dyke] was not that huge - we could have easily fixed it," said 22-year old villager Shou Qiongdan."But the government did not do anything. None of the local officials tried to salvage the situation. That's why we have such huge economic losses and so many people being affected by the flooding."In neighbouring Jiangsu province, the city of Suzhou was hit by more than 200 mm of rainfall on Friday night, and water at the Tai Lake had already exceeded flood alert levels, the China News Service said.In central China's Hubei, two people were killed after the Yangtze river and its tributaries burst their banks, with as many as three million people affected, Xinhua said in a separate report. Further downstream in Anhui province, three died and another 120,000 were evacuated as a result of floods.In southwest China's Sichuan province, five people were killed and another seven remain missing after a water diversion tunnel was flooded on Friday, the China News Service said.Reuters

It's not only the natural disasters that are plaguing rural China, but what we're seeing is (partly) the result of a misguided philosophy that encourages technological solutions to policy problems with their watersheds. Most of the big and small dams of this word are found in China. Most of their floodlands are settled by people. Most of their thirsty crops are farmed in the arid North, not the more temperate South. Climate change will entail more weather extremes. My two cents: If you want to make a sensible investment: Buy a farm. And get your hands on drought and flood resistant crops. And stay the hell away from floodlands, unless it's part and parcel of your farming strategy. - Bumble B, Toronto, CA, 19/6/2011 18:33

 The Christian Post > World|Tue, Jun. 21 2011 10:06 AM EDTMassive China Floods Kill 175, Affect 36 Million PeopleBy Subodh S. Lal | Christian Post Contributor Text Share RSS Print E-mailFloods caused by torrential rains in southern and eastern China since the beginning of the month have left at least 175 people dead and another 86 missing, the Civil Affairs Ministry said Monday.Related Over Half a Million Flee Massive China FloodsHeavy bouts of rain since June 3 have affected over 36 million people and left 1.6 million displaced in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Chongqing Municipality, the ministry said in a statement.In Zhejiang province alone, about 8,400 houses collapsed and many highways were closed, Xinhua news agency reported.A total of 241,600 hectares (597,000 acres) of farmland have been destroyed and 1,846 factories have suspended operations in the province one of Chinas leading manufacturing centers incurring 7.69 billion yuan ($1.18 billion) in direct economic losses, the agency reported.The rain-ravaged people thus await another crisis, a steep rise in food prices.In view of this damage to the crops, the supply of essential commodities, especially vegetable production has already come down by about 20 percent. This has pushed prices up by as much as 40 percent in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, according to Xinhua.Like us on Facebook Farmers have also complained about the shortage of fruits and grains. With the rise in prices of green vegetables, the pressure on inflation has increased, which is already at a three-year high of 5.5 percent.China has mobilized troops to rescue stricken farmers and distribute food, but some villagers from the Zhejiang province said more could have been done to prevent the flooding in the first place..Villagers said the breaches when they first appeared in the dikes were not large and could easily have been fixed. The government did not do anything. None of the local officials tried to salvage the situation, a villager told U.K.s Guardian.Zhao Fayuan, deputy director of Zhejiang provincial flood control headquarters, said Monday that more than 70 km (43 miles) of rural dikes remain close to overflowing in the area around Lanxi city in Zhejiang, reported China Daily. More than 20,000 people could be affected if the dikes are breached. Water has already flowed over a few minor dikes, he added.Questions have also been raised about the efficacy of famed Three Gorges Dam, which was built in the area and was expected to lessen the impact of the yearly flooding.Hubei province, for instance, where the Three Gorges Dam is located, has been severely affected by the floods, according to Xinhua.China Three Gorges Corporation released a social responsibility report Sunday in its defense, even as plans and progress of four other hydroelectric power stations were unveiled.We closely monitor weather conditions and hydrological changes on the Yangtze River and are prepared to control larger floods, said Chen Fei, General Manager of the China Three Gorges Corporation. Flood control is the most important task of our project now, he said, according to China Daily.Rain-triggered floods have also affected 19,000 people in the northwest province of Gansu, where heavy rains have destroyed 474 homes, the provincial Department of Civil Affairs said Monday.The floods have severely affected transportation in the province city of Dunhuang where over 16 km (9.94 miles of railways have been submerged and a major bridge has been destroyed. Electricity and other supplies have also been disrupted.However, no death due to rain has been reported.

Gone With the Flood: Chinese Villagers Struggle With a New Reality By COCO LIU of ClimateWire

XIKOU VILLAGE, China -- The muggy summer afternoon started like any other for Mao Juxian -- with a sink full of dishes to wash at her riverside diner. But within minutes rain began pouring, quickly turning things wrong.

After glimpsing outside her window, Mao was shocked: The river was overflowing and heading straight at her. The 51-year-old and her elderly sister rushed to move whatever they could grab to the upstairs, but the flood was moving faster. In less than an hour, the water inside the house reached their knees, forcing the sisters to retreat to the second floor. But the flood didn't stop its chase. Several hours later, it cut off electricity and phone service, swept away furniture and almost reached the ceiling of their first floor. "We were scared to death, worrying our house would collapse any minute. For the whole night, none of us dared to sleep," recalled Mao. Instead, they were helplessly watching the water rise. Luckily, the flood stopped two feet short of them, and finally faded away in the morning. Three days later, while carrying a wet dining table outside to dry, Mao said she never imagined going through a flood. "This year, we didn't even have rain until two weeks ago. And the river had so little water that parts of its bottom were parched." Such sudden flood from dried-up rivers is rare. But that deluge would not be the last -- nor would it be the worst. Over the past three weeks, China's southern provinces, many of which have yet to recover from an unusual months-long drought, entered a battle against numerous deadly floods. In one such province called Hunan, a cluster of villages that this year saw only one third of the average rainfall, suddenly experienced the heaviest rain in the past 300 years. That caused mudslides that claimed the lives of 20 villagers. Nationwide, the floods killed dozens more, forced millions of people to leave their homes and mounted an extra $5 billion on top of economic losses from the preceding drought. While a rainy June is normal here, such extreme weather and the dramatic shift from dry to wet aren't, says Yang Fuqiang, senior adviser on climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "This is a clear proof of climate change," Yang said. "And it hits less developed regions hardest, making the poor even poorer." Craving rain That's pretty much the situation in Xikou village and its neighboring Kaihua County, where water resources are almost four times the national average and yet villagers are increasingly feeling the pinch in getting water. For Zhou Wenhan, watering his riverbank fields is no longer an easy matter. Over the past years, Zhou witnessed the river level shrinking to a point that no water is able to flow into channels and to reach his fields. And alternative ways like pumping water from underground were abandoned due to prohibitive costs of the operation. While his neighbors can carry water from wells, Zhou can't. The 64-year-old's left hand is paralyzed, leaving him at the mercy of the weather. And this year, as his prayer for rain wasn't answered, Zhou had to make a tough decision. "I switched from growing rice to growing peanuts," he said. "Peanuts can grow with little water, but it only generates half of my previous income." Even for villagers who are physically and financially stronger than Zhou and can soften their dependence on the weather, the missing rain drops didn't go unfelt. Li Zibing, a vegetable grower in neighboring Huadong village, uses a pumping system together with some 400 farmers during low rainfall. But this year's extreme low isn't something that the pump could help with. For every 15 minutes of pumping water, villagers had to wait half an hour until the pump recovered. And not enough water could be fetched and led to their thirsty crops, said Li, adding that the whole village craved rain. The rain did come finally, but not in a way they expected. Livelihoods going down the drain On June 15, a record rain -- the heaviest in the past half century -- dropped on Li's village. It inundated his six-foot-tall greenhouses and destroyed his half-year's hard work within hours. "My peppers had just gotten ripe to be sold. But there is nothing that I can do with them now. By sun rise, they will all go bad," said Li, while staring at a field of peppers covered with a thick layer of brown mud. "Growing vegetables is my only income," he continued. "I am now 50. Even if I want to work in factories, nobody would hire me because I am too old. What else can I do for a living?" Several miles away, another farmer was asking the same question. Handicapped Zhou stood in his peanut field, which a few days ago was rich with green sprouts but is now a mix of muddy dirt and garbage left by the flood. "I planted those peanuts with only one hand. But when the flood came, I could do nothing except watching," sighed Zhou. "The flood was so fierce that it even crashed a brick house next to my field. Who dared to go save crops at such time?" Zhou already restarted planting, and this time he is betting on corn. Still, he isn't sure whether this could help him make ends meet. "Even if I successfully grow the new crops and harvest it, the cost has already doubled. And I have to spend extra cash on fertilizers since my rich soil was washed away by the flood." While Zhou attributes it all to natural forces, some villagers are pointing fingers at a different suspect. Minor impacts for experts, dire consequences for farmers "We believe the flood was caused by upstream hydropower stations which released water amid heavy rains and didn't even notify us," said Lin Weishun, a 48-year-old who runs a pig farm along a river at a nearby village called Yexi. "Before the flood, the river level was very low. Even if rain continued pouring for another few days, it should not have risen so abruptly," Lin explained. While there is no evidence to support Lin's claim, it isn't uncommon for hydropower stations to empty their water reservoirs before heavy rains. And if that isn't timed well, experts say, the released water would intensify floods downstream, though only making a slight impact that would last no more than a day. However, for villagers like the pig farmer Lin, a slight change is big enough to be tipped over the edge. As the river water came flooding, Lin rushed to save his pigs. With water up to his waist, he struggled to catch dozens of small pigs and carried them upstairs to his home. But there was little Lin could do with the bigger ones -- each weighing more than 400 pounds. "I called my brothers to come and help, but the roads were already blocked by the flood. It was so distressing when I saw the flood sweeping away my pigs, but I couldn't do anything," Lin said, while smoking one cigarette after another. The flood took off with two dozen pigs worth $15,000, but what wasn't washed away is Lin's loan. To build this pig farm, he borrowed $2,300 from the bank -- which he would pay back if the pigs weren't lost. Meanwhile, Lin will have to bear another several hundred dollars for rebuilding his pig sheds, which collapsed in the flood. And, until the sheds are ready, pigs are running day and night in Lin's kitchen and living room, leaving their smelly gifts behind. But Lin said he is used to the smell. "I didn't take one day off since I built the farm three years ago. Even during the Chinese New Year, I was still here to clean up pig waste," he said. "And all this hard work is now gone with the flood." Copyright 2011 E&E Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

Heavy downpours cause severe flooding in southwest China's Sichuan Province. At least six people have been killed and thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes. The death toll could increase, as several people are still missing. With water levels still on the rise, local police and rescue teams have been dispatched to help trapped residents escape from homes and buildings. Shop owners have also moved their wares to higher ground. Floods triggered by heavy rains kill hundreds of people and force millions to evacuate each year during China's monsoon season.

One Million Driven from Their Homes from China Flood

The death toll from severe flooding in China has risen to at least 90 people following a week of heavy rain. Another 22 were missing as of Wednesday following the torrential rain, flooding and landslides that have pounded the regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Chongqing, Hubei, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu and Qinghai, according to Xinhua News. Weather observations show that, since Tuesday, light rain has continued to fall, although even this faded away on Wednesday. The end of soaking rain has allowed floodwaters on swollen rivers to crest and recede as of Wednesday. Meteorologists at AccuWeather.com foresee intermittent light rain, but no return of heavy rain through at least the start of next week, so high waters should continue to lower. At one time, more than 1.2 million people had been evacuated from their homes, owing to the flooding, according to multiple reports on line. Wednesday, Xinhua put the figure at 1.39 million in only one province, Sichuan. In hard-hit Sichuan alone, at least 19 people died and another 16 were missing as of Wednesday, Xinhua News said. Its report also spoke of 40,000 houses destroyed in the province. The flooding and heavy rain also affected more than 16,700 hectares (more than 41,000 acres) of crops. Province-wide, economic losses were pegged at 10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion U.S.) since Sept. 16. In Shaanxi, a landslide last Saturday buried a brick works at Baquio, killing 19 people, Xinhua reported on Tuesday. Another 13 were still missing. Earlier, in the Sichuan cities of Bazhong, Dazhou and Guang'an alone, 1.06 million people were evacuated ahead of what Xinhua said was expected to be "the worst flooding since records began in 1847." Floodwaters on the Jialing River, which empties into the mighty Yangtze at Chongqing, crested early in the day on Wednesday, according to Xinhua. One area upstream, the Jialing, had been forecast to crest at the highest levels since record-keeping began in 1847, The Australian said on Tuesday.

132 dead in southern China floods; thousands evacuated

A man on a raft Thursday in a flooded section of downtown Guilin, in southern China. 
BEIJING (AP) Major rivers burst their banks in southern China, triggering massive floods that have killed 132 people and forced 860,000 to flee their homes, the government said Sunday. With dozens missing and more storms forecast, the death toll was expected to rise. More than 10 million people have been affected since torrential rains began June 13, including those who have been injured, stranded or have suffered property losses, the Ministry of Water Resources said in a news release. While the death toll was up from 90 on Saturday, the number of evacuees was lower than the previous day's figure of 1.4 million. Another 86 people are still missing. China sustains major flooding annually along the mighty Yangtze and other major rivers, but this year's floods have been especially heavy, spreading across nine provinces and regions in the south and along the eastern coast. Thousands of houses have been destroyed and economic losses have topped 14 billion yuan, the ministry said. 
More thunderstorms were forecast from Sunday afternoon into Monday, according to the official meteorological bureau. State broadcaster CCTV aired images of rescues performed by boat, truck and helicopter. Waters have surged past safe levels in dozens of rivers, including the Pearl River in the heart of China's industrial powerhouse of Guangdong. The strong storms have collapsed reservoirs, overflowed rivers, caused landslides and power outages and damaged highways. The flooding follows the worst drought in a century for the southern provinces and regions of Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi. It left millions without drinking water and destroyed more than 12 million acres of crops. Copyright 2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Photos: Chinese met office forecasts more rains By IBTimes Staff Reporter | Jun 21, 2011 03:38 AM EDT China's National Meteorological Center on Tuesday forecast more rainfall in flood-hit areas of central and southern China after millions of people were forced to evacuate their homes. The Center also forecast heavy rains at Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces before moving east to Henan and Shandong. Heavy rains resulting in floods ended the worst drought that China faced in decades. China, which is the world's largest producer of cotton and rice, saw its reservoirs overflowing due to heavy rainfall including that of the country's largest freshwater lake Poyang. Rains also aided cultivation of the country's main crops. Rainfall is also likely to help ease inflation that has zoomed to a three-year high of 5.5 percent in May, the official Xinhua news agency said. Floods in China killed at least 175 people with hundreds of thousands evacuated to safer zones. At least 86 people were found missing between June 3 and 20, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said in a statement on Tuesday.

China steps up flood evacuations In pictures: China flooding China drought worsens in parched north 
More than five million people are now reported to have been affected by deadly floods in eastern China. Torrential rain was continuing, leaving large parts of Zhejiang and Hubei provinces under water, state-run news agency Xinhua said. It said nearly 1,000 businesses were being disrupted and crops destroyed, pushing up food prices. This month's flooding - the worst since 1955 - has already left about 170 people dead or missing, reports say. The government has mobilised troops to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people. China's disaster alert has been raised to the highest level, four. Downpours earlier this week triggered landslides that buried houses and killed at least two people in Zhejiang and another two in Hubei. The floods come after months of crop-destroying drought in the centre and north of the country. Some areas along the Yangtze River have suffered their worst drought in half a century. Despite the rain, officials have warned that the crop shortages and dislocation caused by drought will remain severe. Analysts say crop shortages in China could affect prices around the world.

Heavy June rainfall has forced China to evacuate more than 550,000 people from their homes. Massive floods have devastated the central and southern parts of the country, causing rivers to overflow their banks and triggering mudslides. The rains follow the worst drought in China in over 50 years, which has decimated crop yields. 
Since June 13, the damage caused by the rainstorms has led to ... the emergency evacuation of 671,200 people to safety. 
China's Ministry of Civil Affairs 
Overall, 40 rivers have risen above safe limits, stressing dykes and dams including those on China's largest waterway, the Yangtze River, which is flooding downstream while experiencing a severe drought near its source in the north. China's disaster level has been raised to four, the highest on the scale. In a statement on its website on Friday, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs said, "Since June 13, the damage caused by the rainstorms has led to ... the emergency evacuation of 671,200 people to safety." The current round of heavy rains began in early June. Since then, more than a million and a half people have been displaced in the central and southern regions of the country and at least 168 deaths have been reported. Meteorologists in Beijing are predicting more heavy rain in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Zhejiang this weekend.

Chinese villager 
The government has mobilized its forces to aid in the massive evacuations. According to Reuters, local authorities are distributing a box of instant noodles and a carton of bottled water to those affected by the flood. But villagers have reported that survival is difficult, especially for those still trapped by the flood waters in small villages, and distribution of aid is slow, with some not receiving any. A villager was quoted by Reuters: "To be frank, those rescue boats cannot go through those narrow lanes inside the village. A lot of them depend on their relatives rowing small wooden boats to get to them... It is hard to help these people inside there." Another villager, Shou Pengfei said, "Some did not even get any relief items. There is no electricity and you get bitten by mosquitoes all the time."

According to the Beijing Climate Centre, weather trends have shifted drastically. Currently the rain is coming in shorter but fiercer bursts, with protracted periods of drought in between the torrential rain.

The heavy rainfall is not likely to reduce the crop failure caused by months of drought, especially in the north, the heart of China's grain-growing bread basket, where many rivers have dried up. According to reports, the northern countryside has been left devastated by the droughts. Huge dams hundreds of meters wide are now small, muddy pools. Large cities such as Beijing are draining the underground water sources and China is facing a long-term water crisis. Meanwhile, China is engaged in a huge multi-year engineering project designed to move water to the parched north and away from the flooded south. The North-South water project is a massive series of canals and pipes designed to carry water from the Yangtze and Yellow rivers to Beijing. It is likely, analysts predict, that Chinese crop shortages will increase food prices worldwide. Even before the latest flooding, the severe drought in the north caused a shortfall in China's crop yields that will likely affect the price of wheat and may propel a price increase in global markets.

Over half a million people have been evacuated in southern China after four days of torrential rain flooded vast areas of seven provinces. State media are saying that at least 105 people have been killed and 65 are missing. The government has raised its disaster alert to four its highest and the floods are being described as the worst in over 50 years. The army has been mobilized to help with the relief operation. Thousands of people are trapped in their homes waiting to be rescued. Others are doing what they can to help themselves. The worst affected area is in Zhejiang Province where two dykes were breached on Thursday. The waters from the Qianting River poured into two towns and 21 villages. In some places the problem has been made worse by landslides which have blocked rivers and caused further flooding. Forecasters are warning of more rain in the coming days especially in the south-west.Copyright 2011 euronews

Flooding across China has claimed 57 lives as more than a million people are evacuated from their homes. 
Heavy record rains for more than a week have swamped several provinces in northern, central and southwest China, also injuring dozens of people, Newscore reports. 
 The Ministry of Civil Affairs said in a statement that the rain had forced authorities to evacuate more than 1.2 million people from their homes, BBC reports. 
 Landslides and mudslides have toppled homes and blocked roads in the area, and the National Meteorological Center forecast that the torrential rains that caused them will last for another three days, AFP reports. 
 "Constant strong rainfall has caused serious flood disasters in Sichuan [southwest], Shaanxi [north] and Henan [central] - 12.3 million people were affected, 57 died and 29 are missing," it said. 
 One area of the southwestern province of Sichuan, Bazhong, was severely affected, with 13 people killed, 10 missing and 156 injured, a spokesman for the local government told the official China Daily newspaper. 
 Parts of China's longest river, the Yangtze, recorded reaching seven meters above dangerous levels and was expected to rise to the highest level since 1847, the Herald Sun reports. 
 Last year saw China's worst flooding in a decade, leaving more than 4300 people dead or missing. 
 The floods have caused nearly $3 million in damage and submerged 29,000 houses across the three provinces, according to China's Ministry of Civil Affairs.

Del.icio.us Facebook Stumbleupon Newsvine Yahoo bookmarks Mixx Digg Reddit Google Bookmarks Twitter LinkedIn Play CBS News Video (AP) BEIJING - More than 5 million people have been displaced or otherwise affected by flooding in eastern China that is also pushing up food prices, state media reported Sunday. Torrential rains have left huge areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces under water, with more than 1 million acres of farmland inundated, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Almost 1,000 businesses have been forced to suspend operations and 5.7 million people have had their lives disrupted, Xinhua said in a brief report. More than 7,000 homes collapsed or were otherwise damaged and direct financial damage was estimated at almost 6 billion yuan. The downpour triggered a mudslide that buried houses and killed two people in Zhejiang's Changshan county, while two more were killed and two left missing by flooding in Hubei, Xinhua said. Flooding in eastern and southern China this month has left more than 170 people dead or missing. Roads and railways have been blocked, but aid supplies are arriving and the country's weather bureau says skies are expected to clear up Monday. Farmers quoted by Xinhua said the flooding was the worst in 20 years, reducing vegetable output by 20 percent and also causing shortages of fruits and grains. Prices for green vegetables were up 40 percent, Xinhua said, adding to an inflation rate of 5.5 percent, a three-year high. The increase in the consumer price index reported last week was in line with expectations but higher than April's 5.3 percent and March's 5.4 percent. The National Statistics Bureau said the main factor was an 11.7 percent jump in food prices. Higher food prices blamed on flooding were also reported in the eastern provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, Xinhua said. 2011 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

BEIJING (AP) More than 5 million people have been displaced or otherwise affected by flooding in eastern China that is also pushing up food prices, state media reported Sunday. Torrential rains have left huge areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces under water, with more than 1 million acres (432,200 hectares) of farmland inundated, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Almost 1,000 businesses have been forced to suspend operations and 5.7 million people have had their lives disrupted, Xinhua said in a brief report. More than 7,000 homes collapsed or were otherwise damaged and direct financial damage was estimated at almost 6 billion yuan ($930 million). The downpour triggered a mudslide that buried houses and killed two people in Zhejiangs Changshan county, while two more were killed and two left missing by flooding in Hubei, Xinhua said. Flooding in eastern and southern China this month has left more than 170 people dead or missing. Roads and railways have been blocked, but aid supplies are arriving and the countrys weather bureau says skies are expected to clear up Monday.

 MORE than a million people in China have been evacuated following downpours that have raised water levels in rivers to critical highs, and triggered floods and landslides, the government has said. 
The summer rains have left at least 168 people dead or missing so far, and weather authorities warned today that flood-hit areas across the southern half of China would experience a fresh round of heavy rainfall."These areas must strengthen their prevention of geological disasters," the National Meteorological Centre said.Authorities have evacuated more than a million people in eight provinces, regions and municipalities since June 9, the civil affairs ministry said late on Thursday.One waterway in the eastern province of Zhejiang has risen to its highest levels in 56 years, while other rivers across southern China have burst their banks, the nation's flood control headquarters added.

Some of the areas being pounded by rain, such as Hubei and Hunan provinces, were only recently in the thrall of a severe drought, which has in some cases made the situation worse.A week ago, a landslide blasted through villages in Hunan before dawn, killing at least 19 people and leaving another eight missing. One village saw most of its houses buried by mud, state media reported.Experts sent to investigate said the mudslide was triggered by the heaviest rain in the area in 300 years, adding the ground was drier than usual because of the drought, making it easier for downpours to sweep away sand and rocks.China is hit by heavy summer rainfalls every year. In 2010, torrential downpours across large swaths of the country triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade, leaving more than 4300 people dead or missing.A devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu killed 1500 people in August.

The flooding has caused more than $700m worth of damage,with the Zhejiang province hit especially hard[Reuters] 
More than five million people are believed to have been affected by severe floods in eastern China, amid predictions offurther heavy rains in the coming days. The Chinese government has raised its disaster alert to the highest level as the flooding has caused more than $700m worth of damage. "Severe floods triggered by heavy rains will continue to threaten parts of southern China," Chen Lei, minister of water resources, saidon Monday. "There is an increasing possibility that downpours, with enhanced frequency and intensity, will continue to lash regions in the south," he said in a speech posted on his ministry's website. Heavy rainshit Zhejiang province over the weekend and the level of a river that passes through Lanxi city has risen sharply, Zhao Fayuan, deputy director of the flood control headquarters, said. The level of Lanjiang river has now hit 34 metres, the highest since 1966, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. Several sections of the dykes in Lanxi city are barely holding, Zhao said. More than 20,000 people could be affected if the dykes are breached, he said. Torrential rains have left huge areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces under water, with more than one million acres (432,200 hectares) of farmland inundated, theXinhua said. More than 7,000 homes collapsed or were otherwise damaged and almost 1,000 businesses have been forced to suspend operations. Rising death toll Flooding in eastern and southern China this month has left more than 170 people dead or missing. Al Jazeera's Andrew Thomas, reporting from Beijing, said the death toll was rising into hundreds. Farmers quoted by Xinhua said the flooding was the worst in 20 years, reducing vegetable output by 20 per cent and also causing shortages of fruits and grains. Prices for green vegetables were up drastically, Xinhua said, adding to an inflation rate of 5.5 per cent, a three-year high. "The economic cost of this is huge, as crops are being absolutely destroyed in central, southern, and particularly eastern China," our correspondent said. "Some food prices have jumped more than 20 per cent. In one province alone they are estimating the economic loss at more than three quarters of a billion dollars." Torrential downpours across large swathes of the country last year triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade, leaving more than 4,300 people dead or missing.

Rescuers in China are bracing for potentially more flooding just 72 hours after the countrys worst mudslide in decades killed more than 700 people in the northwest Gansu province. Forecasts indicate that more heavy rain is likely.Military and rescue workers are trying to clear debris that is clogging the Bailong River and could create temporary dams which could then burst and send more water and mud rushing into the already devastated region.More than 1,000 people are still unaccounted for and their prospects look grim. Unlike earthquakes where buildings may collapse but leave space for survivors, mudslides envelope an area leaving little hope for those buried beneath it, reports the BBCs Michael Bristow. There are also few roads leading into the mountainous region, so it is difficult for rescue workers and supplies to reach the affected area.With hope fading for finding survivors, authorities are trying to stop potential health crises that could result from the flood damage. Reuters reports that more than 10,000 troops have been sent to the area:Authorities have warned that heavy rain expected in Zhouqu and other areas over coming days could bring the risk of more floods and land slips, including in adjacent Sichuan province.Some 45,000 people have been evacuated from Zhouqu and officials warned others to leave or stay away."We are expecting very heavy rain for later today, please don't spend too long in town," said a policeman at a checkpoint on the outskirts of the town, who declined to give his name.Almost all of the areas drinking water has been contaminated and tens of thousands of people are without clean water and food, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The area is also now largely without a sewage system and toilets. Epidemiologists are concerned that water-borne diseases may be spreading.If we cannot guarantee safe drinking water and a healthy living environment, it is highly risky for infectious disease to occur, Yang Jian, a senior official with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an article in China Daily.Chinas government has allocated $73 million in emergency relief funds for the troubled region, reports state-run Xinhua. The government says it has a three-part plan to help victims. First, the government will help find or provide temporary shelters for the those dislocated by the mudslide; next it will help resettle them with relatives or in rented apartments; finally it will reconstruct destroyed homes. Government officials say they hope to repair damaged houses by this November and to finish rebuilding houses that were completely destroyed by June 2011 at the latest.Though most residents of the flooded region are still coping with the immediate aftermath of the disaster, there is already some anger with the government. Although the flooding and mudslides were sparked by heavy rains on Saturday and made worse by loosened rocks from the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, some Chinese people say the government could have avoided the tragedy. The Guardian reports that deforestation and rapid hydro development were increasing the risk of landslips in the area. Despite government reports warning about this potential catastrophe, the British newspaper says that Chinese authorities did not take preemptive action:"This has happened before. The government knew it could happen again and did nothing to prevent it," said a farmer called Yang, who did not want to give his full name. Five of his relatives were buried in the mudslide and he was digging to find them.For now, questions of government responsibility have been pushed aside as survivors look for their relatives among the rubble. The Peoples Daily Online reports that despite the challenges facing rescue workers, following the flood the government acted swiftly to avert any additional loss of life.

Millions Affected By Floods In Eastern China 
Tweet 
 10:39am UK, Monday June 20, 2011 
 An estimated five million people have been affected by torrential rain, mudslides and flooding in eastern China, local authorities have said.

Large areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces in particular are mostly underwater. The flooding has pushed food prices up and led to a vast number of residents being displaced. So far 180 people have died this month or are missing in the area - and that figure is expected to rise, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The latest downpour - thought to be the worst in 20 years - triggered a mudslide that buried houses and killed two people in Zhejiang's Changshan county. Prices for green vegetables were up 40%, adding to an inflation rate of 5.5% - a three-year high. Two more people were killed and two left missing by flooding in Hubei, Xinhua said. The farmers they interviewed said it was the worst flooding in 20 years.

More than one million acres (432,200 hectares) of farmland has been inundated - though forecasters predicted that Monday would be drier. Almost 1,000 businesses have been forced to suspend operations and 5.7 million people have had their lives disrupted, Xinhua claimed. More than 7,000 homes collapsed or were otherwise damaged and direct financial damage was estimated at almost six billion Yuan (577m). The flooding has reduced vegetable output by 20% and also caused shortages of fruits and grains. On Sunday, a senior official warned a critical point had been reached in battling seasonal floods. Heavy rain pounded Zhejiang over the weekend and the level of a river that passes through Lanxi city has risen sharply, said Zhao Fayuan, deputy director of the flood control headquarters. The level of Lanjiang river has now hit 110 feet (34 metres), the highest since 1966, state-run Xinhua said. Meanwhile more than 40 miles (70 kilometres) of nearby dykes are close to overflowing, the country's flood authority said. It is likely that more frequent and more intense downpours will continue, Chen Lei, China's minister for water resources, told a meeting in Beijing to discuss flood-control measures. However, while the deadly flooding continues, a persistent drought is still plaguing five provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It has left 630,000 people without safe drinking water and affected 11.9 million acres (4.8 million hectares) of farmland, Mr Chen said.

Food prices are expected to rise steeply in China after flooding inundated more than 1 million acres of farmland in eastern provinces, killing at least 100 people and displacing hundreds of thousands more.Weeks of torrential rain in Zhejiang province in the Yangtze delta have caused nearly 6bn yuan (575m) of damage, reducing vegetable production by 20% and pushing prices in the provincial capital of Hangzhou up by as much as 40%, Xinhua news agency said.The rains have forced almost 1,000 businesses to suspend operations and affected the lives of 5.7 million people, China's official news agency said in a brief report. More than 7,000 homes had collapsed or were otherwise damaged. The rains are expected to continue for two days, stretching from the financial hub of Shanghai in the east to rural Yunnan in the far south-west.Farmers quoted by Xinhua reported shortages of fruit and grains. Prices for green vegetables were up 40%, the agency said, adding pressure to inflation already at a three-year high of 5.5%.Villagers on the outskirts of Zhuji in Zhejiang returned to their homes on Sunday as floodwaters receded. Two towns were inundated and thousands of people were evacuated after the breach of two dykes on Thursday. China has mobilised troops to rescue stricken farmers and distribute food, but some villagers said more could have been done to prevent the flooding."When the flooding first started, the breach was not that huge. We could have easily fixed it," said Shou Qiongdan, 22. "But the government did not do anything. None of the local officials tried to salvage the situation. That's why we have such huge economic losses and so many people being affected by the flooding."In neighbouring Jiangsu province, more than 20cm of rain fell on Suzhou city on Friday night, and the Yangtze river and its tributaries burst their banks, affecting up to 3 million people.

The deaths have been concentrated in the poor southern province of Guizhou, where tens of thousands have left their homes to escape the rising waters over the past few days, the official Xinhua news agency said. Another 32 people were missing, the report added, suggesting the death toll could rise. Almost 8,000 houses have been destroyed by the floods and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland inundated, it said. The other deaths have been reported in the eastern seaboard province of Jiangsu, Xinhua added, though other parts of that province remain parched. Guizhou will be hit by more rain over the coming few days, and the government has already sent a relief team to the hardest hit areas, it said. The drought has damaged crops and exacerbated a power shortage by cutting power generation from dams, adding a slight bump to near three-year high consumer inflation. The rains will add to farmers' hopes that they will be able to plant mid-year rice crops after early-season plantings suffered during the drought. The drought has affected millions of hectares of farmland, mainly in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. Rice acreage in these five provinces accounts for nearly half of China's total rice area, official data show. But early-season rice accounted for only 16 percent of China's total rice output of 196 million tones last year.

More rains are predicted for parts of China in the next several days after flooding killed dozens and forced thousands to flee their homes. Heavy rain is forecast to hit Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces before moving east to Henan and Shandong, the National Meteorological Center said today. Rain in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will ease, it said on its website. While the downpours brought floods to central regions, closing airports and roads, they helped end the worst drought in decades, restoring reservoirs and aiding crops in the worlds biggest grower of cotton and rice. That may also help ease inflation that accelerated to 5.5 percent in May, the most since 2008. Poyang, the countrys largest freshwater lake, returned to normal levels, the official Xinhua News Agency said on June 18. The wet spell helped farmers finish planting mid-season rice, likely doing more good than harm except in flood- affected areas, said Wang Fang, analyst at research company Cngrain.com, owned by China Grain Reserves Corp., the manager of the countrys food stockpiles. Apart from rice and cotton, the rains have helped corn where China is the second-biggest grower. The floods killed 175 people and left at least 86 missing from June 3 to June 20, and hundreds of thousands were evacuated, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said in a statement today. Gansu Rains Heavy rains have hit northwest Chinas Gansu province since June 15, affecting a total of 19,742 people in 19 towns in the province, Xinhua reported today, citing the provincial Department of Civil Affairs said on Monday. Floods triggered by the heavy rains in the coastal province of Zhejiang killed two people and left one missing as of 6 p.m. Monday, and caused 5.35 billion yuan ($826 million) of damage, the provincial government said in a statement on its website. Seven provinces including Hubei had a record 60 days without precipitation between March and May, said Chen Zhenlin, a spokesman for the China Meteorological Administration. Shanghai had the least rain through May in 138 years, the city weather bureau said. The dry spell delayed planting of indica rice crops and pushed futures in Zhengzhou to a three-month high. While the change from drought to floods seems surprising, the Yangtze River regions are known to have floods every year, and so far there are no signs this year has been particularly worse, Tommy Xiao, an analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co., said by phone from Shanghai. Crops Helped For most regions, rains aided grain crops including rice and corn, Xiao said. For wheat, northern China was lucky to have already harvested the winter crop, he said. The downpours drenched cotton in Jiangxi, Hubei and Hunan, FCStone Fibers & Textiles wrote in a research note June 17. Producer sentiment generally remains upbeat for replanting and reasonable yields if drier days return, it said. The lower and middle areas of the Yangtze will be mostly dry and cloudy, the weather office said. Rains forecast to move to Henan and Shandong will help corn and cotton in those areas, Xiao said. Henan and Shandong are among Chinas top five corn and cotton producing regions, according to the China Agricultural Yearbook published by the Ministry of Agriculture.

Flooding in China that has killed more than 700 people this year is the deadliest in a decade and is likely to worsen as the country gets deeper into typhoon season, the government warns.However officials, in the first high-level media briefing on weeks of deadly flooding plaguing much of the country's southern half, said a disaster on the scale of historic 1998 flooding on the Yangtze River would likely be averted.A total of 701 people have died so far this year in flooding that has also left 347 people missing, Liu Ning, head of the country's flood control authority and vice-minister of water resources, told reporters on Wednesday.He said the annual rainy season would continue at least through August, and that more downpours were expected, further straining reservoirs and other water control projects, especially as the East Asian typhoon season has just begun."During this period there will be heavy rainfall and serious floods. The rainfall will continue," Liu said.He said meteorologists expected heavy rains could spread to northern China, possibly causing flooding along major rivers such as the Huai, Yellow and Songhua."In these rivers they haven't seen major floods in many years and they are very likely to see some soon. So we must anticipate big disasters," he said.Liu said more than 230 rivers in the country had seen water levels rise beyond warning points, with two dozen exceeding historic highs.Liu did not say how many of the 701 deaths came since June, when the current bout of extreme rains began, but he said 187 of the deaths - and 173 of those left missing - occurred in just the past two weeks.Tens of thousands of homes and other structures have been destroyed in floods and landslides, and economic losses have hit at least 142 billion yuan ($A23.8 billion), with 110 million people affected, he said.The number of deaths and figures for damage are China's worst in 10 years, he added.The floods have dominated the country's attention for weeks, with state television each day broadcasting dramatic images of villagers being rescued from raging rivers or plucked from rooftops in inundated villages.The situation has triggered fears China could see a repeat of the disastrous flooding of 1998, when heavy rain swelled the Yangtze, China's longest river, and many tributaries, leading to a series of devastating levee collapses.At least 4150 people were believed to have died, 18 million were evacuated and millions of homes were destroyed in the floods, the country's worst in recent memory.However, Liu and other officials stressed that lessons learned from 1998, and the 2006 completion of the Three Gorges Dam - which was built partly for flood control - would prevent such a recurrence.He said rainfall levels, although extremely high, have remained 20 per cent lower than those of 1998.And although the upper reaches of the Yangtze drainage basin have seen the highest flood peak since 1987, Liu said the dam would prevent flood surges on the river's upper and lower reaches from "converging" as they did in 1998.He said the government was now feverishly co-ordinating the release of water by dams throughout the region to maintain a smooth flow."The Three Gorges Dam is now playing an effective role in flood control," Liu said, adding that numerous dams and other flood control facilities were built in the wake of the 1998 disaster on the Yangtze."All these efforts have laid a good foundation and act as a pillar in our flood control campaign," he said.However, Liu also acknowledged that six small dams had collapsed this year and more than 1000 displayed potential "risks".

Article ExcerptBY CHUIN-WEI YAP BEIJINGFlooding across eastern, southern and southwestern China has killed at least 175 people and is causing significant damage to vegetable crops, adding to upward pressure on food prices at a time when the government is battling to contain inflation. The flooding, triggered by heavy rains that started early this month, has caused widespread suffering in more than a dozen provinces and regions, with state media calling it the worst in decades in some areas. In addition to the 175 known deaths, 86 people are missing and some 1.6 million people have been displaced by the flooding, which has caused more ...Continue reading article with pop up player

BEIJING -- More than 5 million people have been displaced or otherwise affected by flooding in eastern China that is also pushing up food prices, state media reported Sunday. Torrential rains have left huge areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces under water, with more than 1 million acres (432,200 hectares) of farmland inundated, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Almost 1,000 businesses have been forced to suspend operations and 5.7 million people have had their lives disrupted, Xinhua said in a brief report. More than 7,000 homes collapsed or were otherwise damaged and direct financial damage was estimated at almost 6 billion yuan ($930 million). The downpour triggered a mudslide that buried houses and killed two people in Zhejiang's Changshan county, while two more were killed and two left missing by flooding in Hubei, Xinhua said. Flooding in eastern and southern China this month has left more than 170 people dead or missing. Roads and railways have been blocked, but aid supplies are arriving and the country's weather bureau says skies are expected to clear up Monday. Farmers quoted by Xinhua said the flooding was the worst in 20 years, reducing vegetable output by 20 percent and also causing shortages of fruits and grains. Prices for green vegetables were up 40 percent, Xinhua said, adding to an inflation rate of 5.5 percent, a three-year high. The increase in the consumer price index reported last week was in line with expectations but higher than April's 5.3 percent and March's 5.4 percent. The National Statistics Bureau said the main factor was an 11.7 percent jump in food prices. Higher food prices blamed on flooding were also reported in the eastern provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, Xinhua said.

 Just over a week ago there were many China bashers attacking the Three Gorges Dam as the cause for the 50 year drought that was affecting the same provinces as the flood region now. I shall love to hear from the same people how the 3GD is the cause of the floods now. 
This much should be evident. During the drought the 3GD had impounded water that was used to alleviate the drought. Without the dam there would not be any available water at all. As another commentator said (5 millions flooded out) everything in China is large numbers. That impounded water still barely made an impression on the parched lands as it affected several tens of thousands of square miles. 
Now we have this 50 year flood. Again without the 3GD to hold back the up river waters, had the rainstorms reached the upper reaches of the Yangtze, the floods downriver would have been even more devastating and affect an even bigger area. No the rains haven't reached there yet. But at least there is the very significant comfort that should it rain excessively there the runoff won't reach downriver unrestricted to add to the downriver miseries. Any overabundance of water can be be held back by the 3GD for a controlled release. Nothing much can be done to control the current downriver floods. With the 3GD it is assured that it won't get any worse.

 Keep in mind the population of China. They have 1.3 BILLION people. That's a billion more than the US. I don't think that number is outrageous at all. If anything I'd think the Chinese gov't would be inclined to be conservative.

 NATURAL DISASTERS? 
Electric cars, light bulbs and solar panels won't change anything as weather becomes extreme. It will worsen as China and India's 2,500,000,000 people move up the success ladder and demand more energy. 
Check all earth sciences and you will discover everything in the process of collapse due to over population of the planet including starvation, which has been going on for years, will pick up momentum. 
Dufar in the Sudan looks on the surface to be ethnic cleansing. Next time you look, look not at the starving people but the desert they live in that won't support the winners of this war. 
The Sahara is moving south at 20 miles a year. Soon they will all starve while in China, 37% of the ground water is not fit for human consumption and 34% of that is not fit for irrigation. 
Because people continue reproducing at a breakneck pace, They refuse to recognize that this planet cant sustain 7,300,000,000 devouring everything like a plague of locus in a wheat field. 
Extreme weather at this point is beyond human reach to repair it. Its picking up momentum as anything does when going down hill. We don't have 100's of years left in spite of what many people want to believe. 
The planet will continue to heat up for the next several thousand years since it is now running on automatic and regardless of what you hear not much can be done about it.

 Hope the people are found and returned to normal soon. If the region is a natural flood zone or new farming district, did the dams impact natural flow of water? Is the draining system updated to all connect and filter somewhere needed? To sump pump it out and put where lacking water would make sense,pooled and filtered. Could the crops be pulled from the water and transplanted to other regions or rooftops to grow? May the wasted infrared glasses around here be put to better use with the military on after storm units for trouble as this . Move the displaced into hotels nearby. Dievs to you. ~ Maija from Detroit

 My prayers go out for the people who are mostly poor in the agricultural areas. It will be interesting to see if China asks for help from its allies--not us---or if we can balance our trade deficit with China by sending them our produce at higher prices too, esp since they play monopoly with their yen to our dollar. I would like to see the Arabs, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and Mexico and the other countries that China is cozying up with me offer assistance.

 It's a nice idea, but I doubt that China needs foreign aid from anyone. It has enough cash to by whatever it wants in the way of supplies or equipment and the entire Red Army to call on for search and rescue or reconstrluction.

 If China has enough money to buy its government officials new Audi A6's, it can afford to help its own people out. Its just a question of willingness.

 The Chinese are a very proud (sometimes irrationally) people and they usually do not ask for help from other countries. They will toughen it out.

 I get what you are saying, however, I disagree with you. It's important to have empathy for other people besides us. It keeps us from being inward and selfhish. America is never selfish with their money and that is why we are so blessed. God bless America!

 So if we use your logic, then why is gasoline so cheap in Saudi Arabia than it is in the US? We import crude so according to your logic, gasoline should be higher in Saudi Arabia.

BEIJING (Reuters) Heavy rain drenched a drought-ravaged swathe of southern and eastern China, killing 52 people and forcing more than 100,000 to evacuate, state media reported on Wednesday. The deaths have been concentrated in the poor southern province of Guizhou, where tens of thousands have left their homes to escape the rising waters over the past few days, the official Xinhua news agency said. Another 32 people were missing, the report added, suggesting the death toll could rise. Almost 8,000 houses have been destroyed by the floods and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland inundated, it said. The other deaths have been reported in the eastern seaboard province of Jiangsu, Xinhua added, though other parts of that province remain parched. Guizhou will be hit by more rain over the coming few days, and the government has already sent a relief team to the hardest hit areas, it said. The drought has damaged crops and exacerbated a power shortage by cutting power generation from dams, adding a slight bump to near three-year high consumer inflation. The rains will add to farmers' hopes that they will be able to plant mid-year rice crops after early-season plantings suffered during the drought. The drought has affected millions of hectares of farmland, mainly in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. Rice acreage in these five provinces accounts for nearly half of China's total rice area, official data show. But early-season rice accounted for only 16 percent of China's total rice output of 196 million tones last year.

 It is a disturbing sign of the times that there was a large Shell advert in the middle of this article when I read it. The big oil companies are investing billions in going for the last hard-to-reach reserves of fossil fuels which is destroying our last precious wildernesses and worsening climate change, increasing the likelihood of more extreme weather. 
I am sure AOLHuffpost doesn't mind, as it wallows in the cash, and anyway, these oil companies can afford the best PR firms, so the adverts look nice, and may just kid people that we are not burning our planet up in a deranged, myopic trance.

 thats because people listen to the conservatives who laugh it off.. it's easier for these lazy people to justify not doing anything when they deny it exists.. i think more needs to be done, before it is too late, but too many people go with the mentality.. "only when the last tree has died and the last river been poisoned and the last fish been caught will we realize we cannot eat money". we can't keep trashing our home and expect it to be fine. Serious action needs to be taken!

BEIJING | Fri Jun 10, 2011 10:49am EDT 
BEIJING (Reuters) - Torrential rain in two drought-stricken central China provinces triggered landslides and brought down houses, killing at least 44 people and leaving 33 missing, state media said on Friday. The number of people evacuated from the city of Xianning in Hubei province rose to 100,000 by Friday evening, with thousands still stranded, official news agency Xinhua said.Fierce downpours started on Thursday evening, causing landslides and destroying river embankments in parts of the city. Flood waters reached depths of more than 2 meters (6.5 ft) and 20 people were killed.In the cities of Linxiang and Yueyang in nearby Hunan province, the death toll rose to 19 by late Friday, with another 28 still missing, Xinhua said.The two provinces were among the worst hit by a severe drought in recent months that affected millions of hectares of farmland in central and southern China along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river.Over the weekend, a tropical storm is forecast to hit two other provinces, Xinhua said.The China Meteorological Administration said in a statement on its website (www.cma.gov.cn) that the storm, Sarika, is expected to make landfall near the city of Shantou in southeast China's Guangdong province then head north toward Fujian.The storm may also affect shipping in the key Taiwan Strait, Xinhua said.The drought damaged crops and exacerbated a power shortage by cutting power generation from dams, adding a slight bump to near three-year high consumer inflation.The drought ended last weekend with the rains that have brought deadly floods, so far killing about 100 people in 12 provinces.In eastern Jiangxi province, 1,200 people were stranded by floods after heavy rain fell on the northern part of the province on Thursday, China News Service said in a separate report.(Reporting by Sally Huang and Michael Martina; Editing by Daniel Magnowski)

The deaths have been concentrated in the poor southern province of Guizhou, where tens of thousands have left their homes to escape the rising waters over the past few days, the official Xinhua news agency said. Another 32 people were missing, the report added, suggesting the death toll could rise. Almost 8,000 houses have been destroyed by the floods and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland inundated, it said. The other deaths have been reported in the eastern seaboard province of Jiangsu, Xinhua added, though other parts of that province remain parched. Guizhou will be hit by more rain over the coming few days, and the government has already sent a relief team to the hardest hit areas, it said. The drought has damaged crops and exacerbated a power shortage by cutting power generation from dams, adding a slight bump to near three-year high consumer inflation. The rains will add to farmers' hopes that they will be able to plant mid-year rice crops after early-season plantings suffered during the drought. The drought has affected millions of hectares of farmland, mainly in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. Rice acreage in these five provinces accounts for nearly half of China's total rice area, official data show. But early-season rice accounted for only 16 percent of China's total rice output of 196 million tones last year.

BEIJING | Thu Jun 16, 2011 2:12pm EDT 
BEIJING (Reuters) - Pelting rain in parts of central and southern China has forced hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and prompted the government to demand safety checks on vulnerable dams, news reports said on Thursday. The torrential rains have ended a drought in many areas, but now threaten the Yangtze River basin and nearby provinces with floods and mudslides that have killed at least 105 people.In Jiangxi province in east China, troops helped 122,400 residents move from vulnerable low-lying areas, said the China News Service. In Hubei province in the center, downpours two days ago triggered a landslide that left six people missing and blocked the Pingdu River, forcing 2,000 residents to flee in case a wall of water burst through the mud and debris."Many small dams face major hazards," said China's Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters (fxkh.mwr.gov.cn), adding that "all areas must pay high attention to the safety of dams and hydro stations."In Zhejiang, an eastern province with many manufacturers, officials moved 120,000 residents as surging flood waters cut hundreds of roads and drove the Qiantang River to its highest flood peak since 1955, Xinhua news agency reported late on Thursday.Forecasters warned that in the coming days rains could bring fresh dangers, including in the southwest."Tonight the rains will start from Sichuan province and Chongqing and move east," said meteorologist Li Xiaoquan, according to China's weather news website (www.weather.com.cn).The national forecaster also said heavy showers could hit Guangdong, the export-driven province next to Hong Kong.Floods and mudslides caused by the rain have killed at least 105 people and 65 are missing, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday. No official tally of the total number of deaths has been issued since then.(Reporting by Chris Buckley; editing by Tim Pearce)

China evacuates 500,000 as flooding breaks worst drought in 50 years Water levels on 40 rivers, including the Yangtze, above safety limits as authorities warn of dykes and dams under pressure

 In Zhejiang province, China, the worst drought in 50 years has been followed by deadly floods Link to this video 
China has evacuated more than 500,000 people from deadly floods that are devastating areas in the south of the country following the worst drought in 50 years.At least 105 people have been swept to their deaths or killed in landslides and another 65 are missing after rivers burst their banks. The authorities have issued the highest level of alarm about dykes and dams under dangerous pressure.Television channels that were only recently broadcasting images of dried-up lake beds are now carrying footage of flooded homes and boats plying their way through inundated streets. China Daily said 550,000 people have been forced to leave their homes.The dramatic shift is in line with weather trends identified by the Beijing Climate Centre, which says rain is coming in shorter, fiercer bursts, interspersed by protracted periods of drought.The worst affected province is Zhejiang, where some stretches of the Qiantang river have risen to their highest level since 1955, according to the Flood Control and Drought Relief Office.In the Zhuji district, which has had 40.5cm of rain since the start of the month, the Puyang river inundated 88 villages and 13,000 hectares of crops.In neighbouring Jiangxi province, troops have helped 122,400 residents evacuate from vulnerable lowlands, according to the China News Service. Roads have been closed and bridges have collapsed in the floods, which have also affected Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou provinces.Monitoring stations on 40 rivers have recorded water levels above the safety limit, including Asia's biggest waterway the Yangtze which is simultaneously suffering a flood downstream and a drought closer to its source.Meteorologists warned that the torrential downpours are forecast to move southwards or inland. Li Xiaoquan was quoted on China's weather news website as saying that the rains were expected to affect Sichuan, Chongqing and Guangdong provinces before easing on Sunday.Additional reporting by Cecily Huang

Gone With the Flood: Chinese Villagers Struggle With a New Reality By COCO LIU of ClimateWire

XIKOU VILLAGE, China -- The muggy summer afternoon started like any other for Mao Juxian -- with a sink full of dishes to wash at her riverside diner. But within minutes rain began pouring, quickly turning things wrong.

After glimpsing outside her window, Mao was shocked: The river was overflowing and heading straight at her. The 51-year-old and her elderly sister rushed to move whatever they could grab to the upstairs, but the flood was moving faster. In less than an hour, the water inside the house reached their knees, forcing the sisters to retreat to the second floor. But the flood didn't stop its chase. Several hours later, it cut off electricity and phone service, swept away furniture and almost reached the ceiling of their first floor. "We were scared to death, worrying our house would collapse any minute. For the whole night, none of us dared to sleep," recalled Mao. Instead, they were helplessly watching the water rise. Luckily, the flood stopped two feet short of them, and finally faded away in the morning. Three days later, while carrying a wet dining table outside to dry, Mao said she never imagined going through a flood. "This year, we didn't even have rain until two weeks ago. And the river had so little water that parts of its bottom were parched." Such sudden flood from dried-up rivers is rare. But that deluge would not be the last -- nor would it be the worst. Over the past three weeks, China's southern provinces, many of which have yet to recover from an unusual months-long drought, entered a battle against numerous deadly floods. In one such province called Hunan, a cluster of villages that this year saw only one third of the average rainfall, suddenly experienced the heaviest rain in the past 300 years. That caused mudslides that claimed the lives of 20 villagers. Nationwide, the floods killed dozens more, forced millions of people to leave their homes and mounted an extra $5 billion on top of economic losses from the preceding drought. While a rainy June is normal here, such extreme weather and the dramatic shift from dry to wet aren't, says Yang Fuqiang, senior adviser on climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "This is a clear proof of climate change," Yang said. "And it hits less developed regions hardest, making the poor even poorer." Craving rain That's pretty much the situation in Xikou village and its neighboring Kaihua County, where water resources are almost four times the national average and yet villagers are increasingly feeling the pinch in getting water. For Zhou Wenhan, watering his riverbank fields is no longer an easy matter. Over the past years, Zhou witnessed the river level shrinking to a point that no water is able to flow into channels and to reach his fields. And alternative ways like pumping water from underground were abandoned due to prohibitive costs of the operation. While his neighbors can carry water from wells, Zhou can't. The 64-year-old's left hand is paralyzed, leaving him at the mercy of the weather. And this year, as his prayer for rain wasn't answered, Zhou had to make a tough decision. "I switched from growing rice to growing peanuts," he said. "Peanuts can grow with little water, but it only generates half of my previous income." Even for villagers who are physically and financially stronger than Zhou and can soften their dependence on the weather, the missing rain drops didn't go unfelt. Li Zibing, a vegetable grower in neighboring Huadong village, uses a pumping system together with some 400 farmers during low rainfall. But this year's extreme low isn't something that the pump could help with. For every 15 minutes of pumping water, villagers had to wait half an hour until the pump recovered. And not enough water could be fetched and led to their thirsty crops, said Li, adding that the whole village craved rain. The rain did come finally, but not in a way they expected. Livelihoods going down the drain On June 15, a record rain -- the heaviest in the past half century -- dropped on Li's village. It inundated his six-foot-tall greenhouses and destroyed his half-year's hard work within hours. 1 2 Next Page For more news on energy and the environment, visit www.climatewire.net.ClimateWire is published by Environment & Energy Publishing.

The deaths have been concentrated in the poor southern province of Guizhou, where tens of thousands have left their homes to escape the rising waters over the past few days, the official Xinhua news agency said. Another 32 people were missing, the report added, suggesting the death toll could rise. Almost 8,000 houses have been destroyed by the floods and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland inundated, it said. The other deaths have been reported in the eastern seaboard province of Jiangsu, Xinhua added, though other parts of that province remain parched. Guizhou will be hit by more rain over the coming few days, and the government has already sent a relief team to the hardest hit areas, it said. The drought has damaged crops and exacerbated a power shortage by cutting power generation from dams, adding a slight bump to near three-year high consumer inflation. The rains will add to farmers' hopes that they will be able to plant mid-year rice crops after early-season plantings suffered during the drought. The drought has affected millions of hectares of farmland, mainly in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. Rice acreage in these five provinces accounts for nearly half of China's total rice area, official data show. But early-season rice accounted for only 16 percent of China's total rice output of 196 million tones last year.

Title : 
 More than one million evacuated in China floods

BEIJING - More than one million people in China have been evacuated following downpours that have raised water levels in rivers to critical highs, and triggered floods and landslides, the government said on Friday. 
The summer rains have left at least 168 people dead or missing so far, and weather authorities warned on Friday that flood-hit areas across the southern half of China would experience a fresh round of heavy rainfall. 
"These areas must strengthen their prevention of geological disasters," the National Meteorological Centre said. 
Authorities have evacuated more than one million people in eight provinces, regions and municipalities since June 9, the civil affairs ministry said late Thursday. 
One waterway in the eastern province of Zhejiang has risen to its highest levels in 56 years, while other rivers across southern China have burst their banks, the nation's flood control headquarters added. 
Some of the areas being pounded by rain - such as Hubei and Hunan provinces - were only recently in the thralls of a severe drought, which has in some cases made the situation worse. 
A week ago, one landslide blasted through villages in Hunan before dawn, killing at least 19 people and leaving another eight missing. One village saw most of its houses buried by mud, state media reported. 
Experts sent to investigate said the mudslide was triggered by the heaviest rain in the area in 300 years, adding the ground was drier than usual because of the drought, making it easier for downpours to sweep away sand and rocks. 
China is hit by heavy summer rainfalls every year. In 2010, torrential downpours across large swathes of the country triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade, leaving more than 4,300 people dead or missing. 
One devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu killed 1,500 people in August.

Victims of the flood 
Duration: July November 1931 (depending on river)

Areas affected: Yellow River, Yangtze River, Huai River 
The 1931 Central China floods or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred during the Nanjing decade in the Republic of China era. It is generally considered the deadliest natural disaster ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted) and in China.[2] The human deaths are estimated from 145,000,[5] to between 3.7 million to 4 million.[3][4][6]

[edit] Weather history From 1928 to 1930 a long drought preceded the flood.[4] By some accounts abnormal weather over central China began in the winter of late 1930. Heavy snowstorms in the winter were followed by spring thaw/defrost heavy rains that raised the river levels even higher. The rain increased into July and August 1931.[2] In July alone 7 cyclones hit the region. On average two occur per year.[2] [edit] Death tolls and damages caused Chinese sources usually indicate the death toll of the Yangtze River overflow at about 145,000 and affecting 28.5 million.,[7] while most western sources place the death toll from the floods at an estimation between 3.7 and 4 million people.[2][3][4] [edit] Yellow River The Yellow River has historically been considered the "Cradle of Chinese Civilization". Major floods in this river generally have catastrophic agricultural, economic and social impact. The Yellow River flood occurred between July and November 1931. Estimates of the number of people killed in the flood generally range from 1 to 2 million. Figures have shown about 1 million people died of drowning.[citation needed] The river completely inundated 87,000 km2 (20,000,000 acres). [edit] Yangtze River The worst period was from July to August.[4] In July alone, four weather stations along the Yangtze River reported rain totaling over 2ft (0.61m) for the month.[2] The casualties of the Yangtze River overflow region reached 145,000 and affected 28.5 million.[8] [edit] Huai River The Yangtze along with the Huai River flood reached Nanjing city, capital of China at the time, an island in a massive flood zone.[2] Millions died of drowning or from diseases such as cholera and typhus. Wives and daughters were sold, and local residents reported infanticide and cannibalism in stark details to the government.[2] Some of the areas affected included Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hankou, Wuhan, Hanyang, Chongqing. The high watermark was reached on August 19 at Hankou with the level exceeding 53ft (16m) above normal. Comparatively this is an average of 5.6ft (1.7m) above the Shanghai Bund.[2][9] On the evening of August 25 the water through the Grand Canal washed away dikes near Gaoyou lake. Some 200,000 people drowned in their sleep.[2] [edit] Government reactions [edit] Republic era (1930s 1940s) The Huai River Conservancy Commission is one example of a commission promoted by the Nationalist Government to address flood problems.[2] Due to the Second Sino-Japanese war, the Chinese Civil War and the lack of funding, the government only emphasized on small dams along the Yangzte River.[10] [edit] People's Republic era (post 1950) In 1953 Mao Zedong took a trip to the Yangzte River and said: 
The Socialist Three Gorges Dam project should excel other major projects in Chinese history such as Qin Shi Huang's Great Wall and Sui Yang Di's Grand Canal.[10] 
Scientists and officials who raised doubts, like Chen Mingshu, were persecuted as rightists. Li Siguang, a prominent scientist and minister of geological resources, told Mao he would commit suicide if he could not stop the construction of the Three Gorges Dam project.[10] The project did not move beyond planning stage in the Mao era due to Sino-Soviet conflicts and other events of the 1960s such as the Great Leap Forward. China also did not have the resource to build such a dam at the time.[10] The project was restarted in the 1980s and the dam was completed in 2009. [edit] Other floods to follow

More than one million evacuated in China floods Posted: 17 June 2011 1834 hrs 
Photos of 
BEIJING - More than one million people in China have been evacuated following downpours that have raised water levels in rivers to critical highs, and triggered floods and landslides, the government said on Friday.The summer rains have left at least 168 people dead or missing so far, and weather authorities warned on Friday that flood-hit areas across the southern half of China would experience a fresh round of heavy rainfall."These areas must strengthen their prevention of geological disasters," the National Meteorological Centre said.Authorities have evacuated more than one million people in eight provinces, regions and municipalities since June 9, the civil affairs ministry said late Thursday.One waterway in the eastern province of Zhejiang has risen to its highest levels in 56 years, while other rivers across southern China have burst their banks, the nation's flood control headquarters added.Some of the areas being pounded by rain - such as Hubei and Hunan provinces - were only recently in the thralls of a severe drought, which has in some cases made the situation worse.A week ago, one landslide blasted through villages in Hunan before dawn, killing at least 19 people and leaving another eight missing. One village saw most of its houses buried by mud, state media reported.Experts sent to investigate said the mudslide was triggered by the heaviest rain in the area in 300 years, adding the ground was drier than usual because of the drought, making it easier for downpours to sweep away sand and rocks.China is hit by heavy summer rainfalls every year. In 2010, torrential downpours across large swathes of the country triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade, leaving more than 4,300 people dead or missing.One devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu killed 1,500 people in August.- AFP/al

 The Christian Post > World|Tue, Jun. 21 2011 10:06 AM EDTMassive China Floods Kill 175, Affect 36 Million PeopleBy Subodh S. Lal | Christian Post Contributor Text Share RSS Print E-mailFloods caused by torrential rains in southern and eastern China since the beginning of the month have left at least 175 people dead and another 86 missing, the Civil Affairs Ministry said Monday.Related Over Half a Million Flee Massive China FloodsHeavy bouts of rain since June 3 have affected over 36 million people and left 1.6 million displaced in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Chongqing Municipality, the ministry said in a statement.In Zhejiang province alone, about 8,400 houses collapsed and many highways were closed, Xinhua news agency reported.A total of 241,600 hectares (597,000 acres) of farmland have been destroyed and 1,846 factories have suspended operations in the province one of Chinas leading manufacturing centers incurring 7.69 billion yuan ($1.18 billion) in direct economic losses, the agency reported.The rain-ravaged people thus await another crisis, a steep rise in food prices.In view of this damage to the crops, the supply of essential commodities, especially vegetable production has already come down by about 20 percent. This has pushed prices up by as much as 40 percent in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, according to Xinhua.Like us on Facebook Farmers have also complained about the shortage of fruits and grains. With the rise in prices of green vegetables, the pressure on inflation has increased, which is already at a three-year high of 5.5 percent.China has mobilized troops to rescue stricken farmers and distribute food, but some villagers from the Zhejiang province said more could have been done to prevent the flooding in the first place..Villagers said the breaches when they first appeared in the dikes were not large and could easily have been fixed. The government did not do anything. None of the local officials tried to salvage the situation, a villager told U.K.s Guardian.Zhao Fayuan, deputy director of Zhejiang provincial flood control headquarters, said Monday that more than 70 km (43 miles) of rural dikes remain close to overflowing in the area around Lanxi city in Zhejiang, reported China Daily. More than 20,000 people could be affected if the dikes are breached. Water has already flowed over a few minor dikes, he added.Questions have also been raised about the efficacy of famed Three Gorges Dam, which was built in the area and was expected to lessen the impact of the yearly flooding.Hubei province, for instance, where the Three Gorges Dam is located, has been severely affected by the floods, according to Xinhua.China Three Gorges Corporation released a social responsibility report Sunday in its defense, even as plans and progress of four other hydroelectric power stations were unveiled.We closely monitor weather conditions and hydrological changes on the Yangtze River and are prepared to control larger floods, said Chen Fei, General Manager of the China Three Gorges Corporation. Flood control is the most important task of our project now, he said, according to China Daily.Rain-triggered floods have also affected 19,000 people in the northwest province of Gansu, where heavy rains have destroyed 474 homes, the provincial Department of Civil Affairs said Monday.The floods have severely affected transportation in the province city of Dunhuang where over 16 km (9.94 miles of railways have been submerged and a major bridge has been destroyed. Electricity and other supplies have also been disrupted.However, no death due to rain has been reported.

China drought worsens in parched north China helps drought-hit farmers Warning on China desertification 
At least 14 people have been killed in raging flood waters that have swept through south-western Guizhou province. Scores of people are missing, and tens of thousands have left their homes ahead of more flooding. Roads, bridges and hundreds of homes and cars have been destroyed in the onslaught. The floods toll, reported by the state news agency Xinhua, comes after months of crop-destroying drought in the centre and north of the country. The provincial civil affairs office in Guizhou said that floods have hit 11 cities and counties since 3 June. At least 270,000 people have been affected, 45,000 evacuated and 3,000 stranded, said Xinhua. Before the deluge Some areas along the Yangtze River have suffered their worst drought in half a century. Even with the rain - and more is forecast in the coming days - officials have warned that the crop shortages and dislocation caused by drought will remain severe. Large swathes of China have had almost no rain since October, affecting millions of hectares of crops and leaving many short of drinking water. Analysts say crop shortages in China could affect prices around the world. The country's central bank is offering emergency loans for drought-relief projects in northern, central and eastern areas. Officials are trying to calm fears over shortages, saying the country has enough in reserve to meet demand. But food prices have been rising quickly in China for months.

 NASA: Doomed satellite won't fall on N. America 
The deaths have been concentrated in the poor southern province of Guizhou, where tens of thousands have left their homes to escape the rising waters over the past few days, the official Xinhua news agency said. Another 32 people were missing, the report added, suggesting the death toll could rise. Almost 8,000 houses have been destroyed by the floods and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland inundated, it said. The other deaths have been reported in the eastern seaboard province of Jiangsu, Xinhua added, though other parts of that province remain parched. Guizhou will be hit by more rain over the coming few days, and the government has already sent a relief team to the hardest hit areas, it said. The drought has damaged crops and exacerbated a power shortage by cutting power generation from dams, adding a slight bump to near three-year high consumer inflation. The rains will add to farmers' hopes that they will be able to plant mid-year rice crops after early-season plantings suffered during the drought. The drought has affected millions of hectares of farmland, mainly in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. Rice acreage in these five provinces accounts for nearly half of China's total rice area, official data show. But early-season rice accounted for only 16 percent of China's total rice output of 196 million tones last year.

Flooding in China that has killed more than 700 people this year is the deadliest in a decade and is likely to worsen as the country gets deeper into typhoon season, the government warns.However officials, in the first high-level media briefing on weeks of deadly flooding plaguing much of the country's southern half, said a disaster on the scale of historic 1998 flooding on the Yangtze River would likely be averted.A total of 701 people have died so far this year in flooding that has also left 347 people missing, Liu Ning, head of the country's flood control authority and vice-minister of water resources, told reporters on Wednesday.He said the annual rainy season would continue at least through August, and that more downpours were expected, further straining reservoirs and other water control projects, especially as the East Asian typhoon season has just begun."During this period there will be heavy rainfall and serious floods. The rainfall will continue," Liu said.He said meteorologists expected heavy rains could spread to northern China, possibly causing flooding along major rivers such as the Huai, Yellow and Songhua."In these rivers they haven't seen major floods in many years and they are very likely to see some soon. So we must anticipate big disasters," he said.Liu said more than 230 rivers in the country had seen water levels rise beyond warning points, with two dozen exceeding historic highs.Liu did not say how many of the 701 deaths came since June, when the current bout of extreme rains began, but he said 187 of the deaths - and 173 of those left missing - occurred in just the past two weeks.Tens of thousands of homes and other structures have been destroyed in floods and landslides, and economic losses have hit at least 142 billion yuan ($A23.8 billion), with 110 million people affected, he said.The number of deaths and figures for damage are China's worst in 10 years, he added.The floods have dominated the country's attention for weeks, with state television each day broadcasting dramatic images of villagers being rescued from raging rivers or plucked from rooftops in inundated villages.The situation has triggered fears China could see a repeat of the disastrous flooding of 1998, when heavy rain swelled the Yangtze, China's longest river, and many tributaries, leading to a series of devastating levee collapses.At least 4150 people were believed to have died, 18 million were evacuated and millions of homes were destroyed in the floods, the country's worst in recent memory.However, Liu and other officials stressed that lessons learned from 1998, and the 2006 completion of the Three Gorges Dam - which was built partly for flood control - would prevent such a recurrence.He said rainfall levels, although extremely high, have remained 20 per cent lower than those of 1998.And although the upper reaches of the Yangtze drainage basin have seen the highest flood peak since 1987, Liu said the dam would prevent flood surges on the river's upper and lower reaches from "converging" as they did in 1998.He said the government was now feverishly co-ordinating the release of water by dams throughout the region to maintain a smooth flow."The Three Gorges Dam is now playing an effective role in flood control," Liu said, adding that numerous dams and other flood control facilities were built in the wake of the 1998 disaster on the Yangtze."All these efforts have laid a good foundation and act as a pillar in our flood control campaign," he said.However, Liu also acknowledged that six small dams had collapsed this year and more than 1000 displayed potential "risks".

More than one million evacuated in China floods Posted: 17 June 2011 1834 hrs 
Photos of 
BEIJING - More than one million people in China have been evacuated following downpours that have raised water levels in rivers to critical highs, and triggered floods and landslides, the government said on Friday.The summer rains have left at least 168 people dead or missing so far, and weather authorities warned on Friday that flood-hit areas across the southern half of China would experience a fresh round of heavy rainfall."These areas must strengthen their prevention of geological disasters," the National Meteorological Centre said.Authorities have evacuated more than one million people in eight provinces, regions and municipalities since June 9, the civil affairs ministry said late Thursday.One waterway in the eastern province of Zhejiang has risen to its highest levels in 56 years, while other rivers across southern China have burst their banks, the nation's flood control headquarters added.Some of the areas being pounded by rain - such as Hubei and Hunan provinces - were only recently in the thralls of a severe drought, which has in some cases made the situation worse.A week ago, one landslide blasted through villages in Hunan before dawn, killing at least 19 people and leaving another eight missing. One village saw most of its houses buried by mud, state media reported.Experts sent to investigate said the mudslide was triggered by the heaviest rain in the area in 300 years, adding the ground was drier than usual because of the drought, making it easier for downpours to sweep away sand and rocks.China is hit by heavy summer rainfalls every year. In 2010, torrential downpours across large swathes of the country triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade, leaving more than 4,300 people dead or missing.One devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu killed 1,500 people in August.- AFP/al

More than one million evacuated in China floods Posted: 17 June 2011 1834 hrs 
Photos of 
BEIJING - More than one million people in China have been evacuated following downpours that have raised water levels in rivers to critical highs, and triggered floods and landslides, the government said on Friday.The summer rains have left at least 168 people dead or missing so far, and weather authorities warned on Friday that flood-hit areas across the southern half of China would experience a fresh round of heavy rainfall."These areas must strengthen their prevention of geological disasters," the National Meteorological Centre said.Authorities have evacuated more than one million people in eight provinces, regions and municipalities since June 9, the civil affairs ministry said late Thursday.One waterway in the eastern province of Zhejiang has risen to its highest levels in 56 years, while other rivers across southern China have burst their banks, the nation's flood control headquarters added.Some of the areas being pounded by rain - such as Hubei and Hunan provinces - were only recently in the thralls of a severe drought, which has in some cases made the situation worse.A week ago, one landslide blasted through villages in Hunan before dawn, killing at least 19 people and leaving another eight missing. One village saw most of its houses buried by mud, state media reported.Experts sent to investigate said the mudslide was triggered by the heaviest rain in the area in 300 years, adding the ground was drier than usual because of the drought, making it easier for downpours to sweep away sand and rocks.China is hit by heavy summer rainfalls every year. In 2010, torrential downpours across large swathes of the country triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade, leaving more than 4,300 people dead or missing.One devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu killed 1,500 people in August.- AFP/al

Cairo: Saudi Embassy Attacked 
September 14, 2011 9:20 AM - Written by 
Tim Marshall 
Not many people know this, but the Israeli Embassy was not the only one attacked in Cairo last weekend.The Embassy of Saudi Arabia was also stormed by a mob. Strangely the Egyptian media mostly kept quiet about it. The Muslim Brotherhood, which welcomed the assault on the 'murderous Nazi Jewish invaders' had nothing to say about the Saudi incident.Several cars were set alight but there was only minor damage to the building. however, it begs the question - why the Saudi Embassy?...

The crimes of the Gaddafi dictatorship are legion and well documented, the brutality of the anti Gaddafi forces this year less so, until now.Amnesty International (of which I am a member) has published a 107 page report 'The Battle For Libya' which accuses both sides of war crimes.The report notes that by far the majority of atrocities were carried out by the Gaddafi side but also catalogues those committed by the rebels and warns that these may be continuing....

Cairo: Israeli Embassy Attack Planned

The storming of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo on Friday night was not just planned, it was part of a 60 year campaign of hate which has permeated all levels of Egyptian society and which the current chaos in Egypt is allowing full rein.On the surface the attack was in revenge for the killing of several Egyptian security forces mistakenly shot by the Israelis. The IDF was pursuing a terrorist gang which had killed Israelis in the Eilat region last month....

It's official. After years of speculation the British Foreign Secretary has confirmed the presence of at least one snake deep inside the Foreign Office and hinted that elsewhere in Whitehall many others may be loose slithering about various departments hissing at passing civil servants and journalists.In a speech, given amid the splendour of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, William Hague revealed that there is a 20 foot long anaconda in the building....

The deaths have been concentrated in the poor southern province of Guizhou, where tens of thousands have left their homes to escape the rising waters over the past few days, the official Xinhua news agency said. Another 32 people were missing, the report added, suggesting the death toll could rise. Almost 8,000 houses have been destroyed by the floods and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland inundated, it said. The other deaths have been reported in the eastern seaboard province of Jiangsu, Xinhua added, though other parts of that province remain parched. Guizhou will be hit by more rain over the coming few days, and the government has already sent a relief team to the hardest hit areas, it said. The drought has damaged crops and exacerbated a power shortage by cutting power generation from dams, adding a slight bump to near three-year high consumer inflation. The rains will add to farmers' hopes that they will be able to plant mid-year rice crops after early-season plantings suffered during the drought. The drought has affected millions of hectares of farmland, mainly in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. Rice acreage in these five provinces accounts for nearly half of China's total rice area, official data show. But early-season rice accounted for only 16 percent of China's total rice output of 196 million tones last year.

China floods kill 52 as 100,000 flee homes (AFP) 
Jun 8, 2011 
BEIJING Floods triggered by torrential rain in southern and central China have killed 52 people and forced more than 100,000 to flee their homes, state media reported Wednesday.Another 32 people were missing in the floods which have inundated parts of 12 provinces since the start of June, Shu Qingpeng, deputy head of the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, told a conference, Xinhua news agency said.The southwestern province of Guizhou was the hardest hit, with 21 dead, more than 30 missing and some 100,000 evacuated, Xinhua said in a separate report citing the ministry of finance.Guizhou's Wangmo county recorded 122.5 millimetres (4.8 inches) of rainfall in one hour, the most in 200 years, Shu said.The floods across China have destroyed nearly 7,500 houses and submerged 255,000 hectares (630,000 acres) of farmland, causing direct losses of 4.92 billion yuan ($760 million), he said.Shu warned local authorities to monitor rainfall and water levels as further heavy rains are expected to hit many parts of the country over the next few days.In the province of Hunan, which neighbours Guizhou, around 16,000 people were evacuated in Loudi city during rainstorms, Xinhua reported on Monday.The province has recently been hit by a severe drought, and the recent rains had helped alleviate the situation.China suffers from serious summer rainfalls every year. In 2010, torrential downpours across large swathes of the country triggered the nation's worst floods in a decade.More than 4,300 people died or went missing in China last year in landslides or floods, including 1,500 people who were killed in one devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu in August.China's flood control and drought relief headquarters said Monday that the recent downpours had helped ease a severe drought along the Yangtze river, but warned that more than two million people still faced water shortages.Weather authorities warned that rainfall this month, while relieving drought-hit areas, would also trigger floods in other parts of the country, Xinhua reported.

It's A Fare Cop 
September 21, 2011 11:44 AM - Written by 
Martin Brunt 
As a regular train commuter I'm still waiting to witness a ticket inspector carry out that well-publicised threat to fine or excess-charge anyone travelling without a valid ticket.My experience is that the inspectors are only too ready to sell a transgressor a ticket mid-journey, rather than risk an embarrassing confrontation in a packed carriage. Maybe it's just the lack of real oiks on the 8.10 to Victoria, though I meet plenty on the late-night vomit comet when I'm working late....

The cost of policing the riots in London hasn't come cheap...34 million so far.It's the price paid for swamping the streets with cops (don't forget that was the Yard's idea, not No 10's!).It's made up of normal operational costs, plus overtime for Met cops and payments to the hundreds of officers drafted in from most of the other forces in England and Wales. And feeding them all....

There were no planes, so the three of us piled into a tiny, chartered cabin cruiser for a six-hour, midnight dash from Weymouth through choppy seas to Jersey.Our crew of two seemed to delight in pushing the boat at up to 25 knots as it weaved between massive tankers and ferries.We were so sick and exhausted when we arrived we considered turning off our moblies so the newsdesk might think we had perished and leave us alone....

Jersey Murders Stewart_Gull Ipswich_Murders 
About this blog Someone once said that a journalist's job offers a front-row seat at the peep show of life. True. And even more so for a crime reporter. All human life is on my beat. It's a world of villains, heroes, heartache and triumph over adversity. And that's just the scene around my family breakfast table before I set off for work.My job can be as dull as everyone else's, but not very often. Most of the time it's fascinating.And I've often thought the most interesting stuff is what happens before, after and around the story that you see on the telly.My Life of Crime diary, or blog as I'm learning to call it, aims to bring you all that. I will write it up as often as time permits. And I'd like to hear your views. Again, I'll respond when I can. Oh, and if you have any stories for me to report please email me or 'blog' them to me.... Preferably, stories in the Maldives.The pavement outside Scotland Yard is often cold and wet. And that's in July.

Flooding in China that has killed more than 700 people this year is the deadliest in a decade and is likely to worsen as the country gets deeper into typhoon season, the government warns.However officials, in the first high-level media briefing on weeks of deadly flooding plaguing much of the country's southern half, said a disaster on the scale of historic 1998 flooding on the Yangtze River would likely be averted.A total of 701 people have died so far this year in flooding that has also left 347 people missing, Liu Ning, head of the country's flood control authority and vice-minister of water resources, told reporters on Wednesday.He said the annual rainy season would continue at least through August, and that more downpours were expected, further straining reservoirs and other water control projects, especially as the East Asian typhoon season has just begun."During this period there will be heavy rainfall and serious floods. The rainfall will continue," Liu said.He said meteorologists expected heavy rains could spread to northern China, possibly causing flooding along major rivers such as the Huai, Yellow and Songhua."In these rivers they haven't seen major floods in many years and they are very likely to see some soon. So we must anticipate big disasters," he said.Liu said more than 230 rivers in the country had seen water levels rise beyond warning points, with two dozen exceeding historic highs.Liu did not say how many of the 701 deaths came since June, when the current bout of extreme rains began, but he said 187 of the deaths - and 173 of those left missing - occurred in just the past two weeks.Tens of thousands of homes and other structures have been destroyed in floods and landslides, and economic losses have hit at least 142 billion yuan ($A23.8 billion), with 110 million people affected, he said.The number of deaths and figures for damage are China's worst in 10 years, he added.The floods have dominated the country's attention for weeks, with state television each day broadcasting dramatic images of villagers being rescued from raging rivers or plucked from rooftops in inundated villages.The situation has triggered fears China could see a repeat of the disastrous flooding of 1998, when heavy rain swelled the Yangtze, China's longest river, and many tributaries, leading to a series of devastating levee collapses.At least 4150 people were believed to have died, 18 million were evacuated and millions of homes were destroyed in the floods, the country's worst in recent memory.However, Liu and other officials stressed that lessons learned from 1998, and the 2006 completion of the Three Gorges Dam - which was built partly for flood control - would prevent such a recurrence.He said rainfall levels, although extremely high, have remained 20 per cent lower than those of 1998.And although the upper reaches of the Yangtze drainage basin have seen the highest flood peak since 1987, Liu said the dam would prevent flood surges on the river's upper and lower reaches from "converging" as they did in 1998.He said the government was now feverishly co-ordinating the release of water by dams throughout the region to maintain a smooth flow."The Three Gorges Dam is now playing an effective role in flood control," Liu said, adding that numerous dams and other flood control facilities were built in the wake of the 1998 disaster on the Yangtze."All these efforts have laid a good foundation and act as a pillar in our flood control campaign," he said.However, Liu also acknowledged that six small dams had collapsed this year and more than 1000 displayed potential "risks".

Devastating floods in eastern China have hit more than five million people in eastern China.The flooding triggered a mudslide that buried houses and killed two people in Zhejiang Province's Changshan county, while two more were killed and two left missing in Hubei Province.Torrential rains have left one million acres of farmland in the provinces under water, said the official Xinhua News Agency. 
Desperation: Farmers push a boat carrying their pigs at a flooded area in Lanxi city, Zhejiang province as torrential rain floods the country 
To the rescue: A military boat helped farmers transport their pigs from a flooded hog pen, as citizens try to save their possessions 
In safe hands: The farmers and military rescue the pigs from the rising tides So far 7,000 homes have been destroyed, more than a million people evacuated,1,000 business operations suspended and 5.7 million Chinese have had their lives disrupted. Local authorities are distributing aid, handing out a box of instant noodles and a carton of bottled water. But villagers have reported that survival is difficult, especially for those still trapped by the flood waters.

It's not only the natural disasters that are plaguing rural China, but what we're seeing is (partly) the result of a misguided philosophy that encourages technological solutions to policy problems with their watersheds. Most of the big and small dams of this word are found in China. Most of their floodlands are settled by people. Most of their thirsty crops are farmed in the arid North, not the more temperate South. Climate change will entail more weather extremes. My two cents: If you want to make a sensible investment: Buy a farm. And get your hands on drought and flood resistant crops. And stay the hell away from floodlands, unless it's part and parcel of your farming strategy. - Bumble B, Toronto, CA, 19/6/2011 18:33

The deaths have been concentrated in the poor southern province of Guizhou, where tens of thousands have left their homes to escape the rising waters over the past few days, the official Xinhua news agency said. Another 32 people were missing, the report added, suggesting the death toll could rise. Almost 8,000 houses have been destroyed by the floods and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland inundated, it said. The other deaths have been reported in the eastern seaboard province of Jiangsu, Xinhua added, though other parts of that province remain parched. Guizhou will be hit by more rain over the coming few days, and the government has already sent a relief team to the hardest hit areas, it said. The drought has damaged crops and exacerbated a power shortage by cutting power generation from dams, adding a slight bump to near three-year high consumer inflation. The rains will add to farmers' hopes that they will be able to plant mid-year rice crops after early-season plantings suffered during the drought. The drought has affected millions of hectares of farmland, mainly in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. Rice acreage in these five provinces accounts for nearly half of China's total rice area, official data show. But early-season rice accounted for only 16 percent of China's total rice output of 196 million tones last year.

Is Cameron Turning Into Blair? 
September 22, 2011 7:53 PM - Written by 
Jon Craig 
David Cameron's speech to the United Nations, about using force against tyrants, could have been made by Tony Blair.In fact, comparisons are already being drawn between Cameron's New York speech in 2011 and Tony Blair's Chicago speech in 1999, when he made the case for military action in Kosovo.Listen to what Cameron says about saving lives and preventing slaughter in Libya and the message is essentially the same as Blair's about Kosovo.Cameron demanded sanctions against Syria,...

Nick Clegg's Speech: A Quiet Success 
September 21, 2011 4:08 PM - Written by 
Sophy Ridge 
When Nick Clegg started his speech, his tone was sombre and serious - almost a monotone.It's been "painful", he said. "None of us predicted just how tough it would be.""We've lost support, we've lost councillors, and we lost a referendum" - as if they needed reminding.The atmosphere in the room was not jubilant by any means. There were moments of cheers and claps - but a lot of empty silence to match the empty seats.All this sounds pretty gloomy.But the truth is,...

Britain is just months away from what could be the most disruptive national strike action in years.Unions are calling for national campaigns of 'civil disobedience' to protest against cuts to pensions and public services.This so-called 'autumn of discontent' is almost upon us, but going by the speeches at the Lib Dem conference, you'd never know it.Some of the party's most prominent ministers are at heart of the controversial coalition economic policies that are driving union anger....

I've been passed a leaked copy of the Energy Secretary Chris Huhne's speech to party conference - and it will make uncomfortable reading for some Conservatives.There's lots of details about energy prices and Ofgem - but I'm more interested in the final climax where Mr Huhne sends a clear warning shot to right wing MPs.It's the most outspoken swipe at the Tory right by a minister so far at conference.After discussing US politics,...

A BBC kazoo, blown by Lib Dem luminaries like Sarah Teather, last night became the subject of a ham-fisted police terror investigation.While officers elsewhere in Birmingham were preparing to make seven arrests as part of a large anti-terror operation, some of their colleagues near the conference centre were pursuing a rather unlikely target.A BBC radio producer had been merrily drinking away at a fringe event hosted by the Policy Exchange at the Hyatt Regency....

Torrential rains batter parts of China, floods spread 
 16 Jun 2011 18:39

 // Reuters 
* Rains bring floods, landslides in centre, south * 120,000 evacuated in Zhejiang province in east 
By Chris Buckley BEIJING, June 16 (Reuters) - Pelting rain in parts of central and southern China has forced hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and prompted the government to demand safety checks on vulnerable dams, news reports said on Thursday. The torrential rains have ended a drought in many areas, but now threaten the Yangtze River basin and nearby provinces with floods and mudslides that have killed at least 105 people. In Jiangxi province in east China, troops helped 122,400 residents move from vulnerable low-lying areas, said the China News Service. In Hubei province in the centre, downpours two days ago triggered a landslide that left six people missing and blocked the Pingdu River, forcing 2,000 residents to flee in case a wall of water burst through the mud and debris. "Many small dams face major hazards," said China's Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, adding that "all areas must pay high attention to the safety of dams and hydro stations." In Zhejiang, an eastern province with many manufacturers, officials moved 120,000 residents as surging flood waters cut hundreds of roads and drove the Qiantang River to its highest flood peak since 1955, Xinhua news agency reported late on Thursday. Forecasters warned that in the coming days rains could bring fresh dangers, including in the southwest. "Tonight the rains will start from Sichuan province and Chongqing and move east," said meteorologist Li Xiaoquan, according to China's weather news website. The national forecaster also said heavy showers could hit Guangdong, the export-driven province next to Hong Kong. Floods and mudslides caused by the rain have killed at least 105 people and 65 are missing, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday. No official tally of the total number of deaths has been issued since then. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; editing by Tim Pearce)

80 Armed Police Officers Killed by Mountain Torrent in Fujian 
The death toll caused by mountain torrents that hit an armed police unit in east China's Fujian Province Sunday night rose to 80 on Friday, rescuers said. Among the 57 people saved, 39 were wounded and hospitalized. Some of them have recovered. Rescuers are still searching for the 5 people who remain missing, the sources said. Servicemen, policemen and local residents have been engaged in the rescue work over the past five days and have recovered 80 bodies. The sudden downpour brought by Typhoon Longwang hit the unit stationed in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province, Sunday night, when mountain torrents dashed against two houses and washed away people inside. The reason for the disaster is under investigation, the sources said. (Xinhua News Agency October 8, 2005)

United Nations, Sep 20 (IANS) The UN has made an appeal for around $357 million to help the Pakistani government in providing assistance to over five million people affected by floods in the country, a UN spokesman said. The appeal named the UN Rapid Response Plan for 2011 aims to provide food, water, sanitation, health and emergency shelters to the worst hit families in Pakistans southern provinces of Sindh and Balochistan over the next six months, Xinhua quoted Martin Nesirky as saying Monday. Valerie Amos, UN under-secretary-general for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, said: More than five million people are struggling to survive massive flooding across southern Pakistan, and the rains continue to fall. This years rains have affected 5.4 million people in Sindh and Balochistan, destroyed nearly one million homes, and forced at least 824,000 people to move into make-shift settlements, according to reports. The UN has distributed more than 20,000 shelter kits and household goods, as well as 530,000 plastic sheets, statistics said. More than 650,000 people have received medical care, and 500,000 people will receive food aid by the end of September. The UN also aims to provide 400,000 people with access to safe drinking water over the coming days. Devastating floods in Pakistan in 2010 affected around 20 million people, and resulted in 2,000 deaths.

China's chance to be our economic saviour | Dean Baker 
Posted: Thu, 22 Sep 2011 17:30:01 GMTPosted: 2011-09-22T17:30:01Z The US is no longer capable of pulling the world out of economic crisis. Only China has the resources if it chooses to use themCan China save the world economy? That is a question that people should be asking as the other potential candidates withdraw from the race. At the moment, the economies of the United States, Europe and Japan are all suffering from weak growth or worse. The debt crisis of eurozone countries threatens another financial crisis that could lead to another plunge in output, not just in Europe but throughout the world.Meanwhile, the actors who could, in principle, take steps to reverse this dismal course of events are largely paralysed. The eurozone countries are struggling with efforts to form the necessary fiscal union to support their currency. This requires creating a new legal structure, while also confronting intense political opposition in Germany and other better-off countries that will be asked support the debt of the Greece and other struggling economies.Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is finding it difficult to break with its cult of 2.0% inflation targeting even after the economic disaster caused by this single-minded policy focus. It actually raised its overnight rate by 0.5 percentage points in the spring, slowing growth and increasing the cost of borrowing for debt-burdened governments. The United States does not face the same imminent crisis, but it is likely to see slow growth and rising unemployment as both fiscal and monetary policy are largely checkmated by politics. Furthermore, a eurozone financial freeze-up will almost certainly lead to a double-dip recession in the US, as well.And Japan has just seen another prime minister sent packing after failing to deal effectively with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami. The country now has its fourth prime minister in four years.With the key actors in the wealthy countries either unwilling or unable to take the necessary steps to support the world economy, it is reasonable to ask whether China can fill the gap. Certainly, China has the ability to act as a backstop for the world economy, if it chooses to play this role.On a purchasing power parity basis, China's economy is already more than 75% as large as the US economy. It is projected exceed the size of the US economy by 2016. China also has a vast amount of reserves, holding almost $1.2tn in US dollar assets, and has close to $2tn in total reserves.It would need only a small fraction of this wealth to have an enormous impact on the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In the case of Greece, it would need to set some floor on the value of Greek debt as an orderly restructuring is arranged. Greece has roughly $450bn in debt outstanding. Much of this debt has already been partially written down by its holders. Certainly, $100bn in debt purchases would be more than sufficient to arrange an orderly write-down and restructuring of Greece's debt to a sustainable level.The other troubled countries actually suffer primarily from a crisis of confidence more than a serious debt problem. For example, Spain has a debt to GDP ratio that is just over 60%, well within anyone's conception of manageable. Italy has a more troubling debt to GDP ratio of 120%, but has a near-balanced budget. In both cases, if interest rates could be kept at reasonable levels, the debt burden could be easily met.Interest rates on both countries' bonds have soared in recent months as the ECB has demanded harsh austerity measures at a time when the downturn has sent budget deficits soaring. The austerity measures threaten a downward spiral where weak growth leads to rising deficits, which, in turn, require further austerity measures. With the ECB determined to tell investors that sovereign debt can default, they have created a perfect recipe for a self-imposed disaster.China can reverse this picture by providing guarantees to support the bonds of these governments. By setting a floor on the price of their bonds (or a cap on interest rates), it can ensure that they can borrow at interest rates that make their debt sustainable. In addition, by easing up on the austerity measures demanded by the ECB (actually, the IMF and European Union are also actors in this story), China's intervention can help these countries to return to normal levels of growth, reducing the burden of the debt in the future. It is likely that such guarantees would never cost China anything, since the debt-burdened European governments would have little problem meeting their debt service obligations once they return to healthy growth path.This sort of intervention by China would not require altruism. Europe is a substantial market for China's exports, as is the United States. If the eurozone collapses, the resulting financial crisis and economic fallout will send China's exports plummeting, just as happened in the fall of 2008. China already intervenes to support its exports that is why it holds almost $1.1tn in US government debt so this idea of intervening to sustain export markets is not new to the Chinese government. The only thing that would be new would be the form of the intervention.If China were to take this path, it would provide enormous benefits to the world economy. The wealthy countries would have to acknowledge China's role as the leading economic force in the world. They would also have to acknowledge the errors of their boneheaded economic leadership that put them in a situation where they could not rescue their own economies.Global economyChinaEconomicsFinancial crisisEuroGreeceUS economyPublic financeEuropean Central BankIMFEuropean UnionUS economic growth and recessionBondsMarket turmoilDean Bakerguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Pendulum of intellectual fashion swings over the death penalty 
Posted: Thu, 22 Sep 2011 11:13:44 GMTPosted: 2011-09-22T16:14:19Z Troy Davis's execution caused a greater outcry than usual in the US. But would justice have been better served by commutation?I was at a Scouts camp in Cornwall one brisk spring morning in 1960 when we heard that Caryl Chessman, a Californian robber and rapist, had finally been executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin jail after 12 years on death row. Years later, I discovered that my future Guardian boss, Ian Aitken 84 this week had been one of the reporters covering his last hours.Deja vu all over again this morning when mainstream media confirmed angry overnight reaction in the Twittersphere to the news that Troy Davis was executed by lethal injection in a prison south of Atlanta, Georgia, in the early hours of today despite the now-familiar rituals of last minute appeals and delays, granted then overturned as in the Chessman case.This time, the process has taken 22 years since Davis was convicted of the shooting of Mark MacPhail, an off-duty policeman trying to break up a brawl. Davis died still protesting his innocence as he had during the long legal battle for his life during which key witnesses tried to withdraw their evidence as Ed Pilkington, at the prison in Jackson, as Aitken was at San Quentin 51 years ago, explains here in 10 crisp points.Five hundred protesters were outside the jail, and countless prominent people and organisations around the US and the wider world appealed for clemency. The US supreme court was instrumental in ensuring that Davis's fourth execution date would be his last.A woman reporter who has witnessed 12 executions in the state (she practices detachment and always has a "very, very long shower" afterwards, she told Radio 4's Today programme) said she had not experienced such an outcry before.She also sounded a bit perky for my taste, but seemed satisfied that the evidence against Davis was solid. To many people in many countries, that detail will matter. To others, the principle that capital punishment the state taking lives in cold blood is the only thing that matters and is wrong in any circumstances.Broadly speaking, that is the European view nowadays, though the abolitionist movement has grown worldwide in recent decades 96 countries have abolished the death penalty compared with 16 barely 30 years ago.Russia is one of them, whereas the US (46 executions in 2010) and China an estimated 5,000 are not. Iran (252-plus) and North Korea (62-plus) are in the No 2 and No 3 spot, Muslim states being most conspicuous on the execution list. Japan executed two people.Plenty of ironies to chew over in that list. Europe, the most godless continent, opposes capital punishment but is a world leader in promoting abortion. China, at least, has the consistency of supporting what some call the "double death" approach.Today's Times carries a report on Davis's impending death but a more censorious and prominent one on Iran's execution of a 17-year-old in public and from a crane.Alireza Molla-Soltani had also been convicted of murder, killing a well-known athlete after a driving dispute as recently as July (they don't hang around with appeals in Iran). He claimed to have acted in self-defence and called out for his mother as the crowd cried: "Allah Akbar". His age officials claimed he was 18 by their calendar amounts to a breach of international law, critics say.By coincidence (not?), President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is due to address the UN general assembly today, his usual fiery anti-western rant, doubtless inflamed by persistent speculation that the clerical authorities who call the shots and hangings in Iran are getting fed up with his economic mismanagement.We know the feeling, don't we? Also in New York, David Cameron's speech, the BBC reports in the adjoining item to Troy Davis's execution, will call on the international community to intervene more, Libya-style, "to stop repressive regimes from slaughtering their own people". Another irony there, then it will probably go unremarked at Turtle Bay.But examination of the Davis case requires several threads to be unpicked. Those who oppose capital punishment in all circumstances don't have a problem it's always wrong. I don't take that view.States and societies have reserved the right to execute people for a variety of crimes from treason to stealing a loaf of bread down the ages, and some still do. The pendulum of intellectual fashion, if I can call it that (I think I will) moves both ways over time, allowing everyone to take a turn at feeling superior.In the US, the issue is one for the 50 states to decide, not a federal issue under the constitution of 1787. Most still do it occasionally, 14 (plus the District of Columbia) don't, mostly in the mid-west and north-east. Michigan alone never has done.In Britain, abolitionists have been reducing the list of capital crimes for 200 years and had it suspended for murder in 1965 (mainland only), made permanent in 1969. The last offences including treason went in 1998, and the UK signed the 13th protocol of the European convention on human rights in 2003-4, so there the decision remains for the future.During the course of the 20th century, we seem to have executed nearly 700 people. Were mistakes made? Of course, and it was Timothy John Evans's hanging in 1950 on the evidence of the serial murderer John Christie which crucially turned public opinion and home secretaries away from the practice. But the other side can argue, and does, that mistakes that allow killers to kill again also results in the deaths of innocents. It's a powerful point too.In the case of Davis, things seem, if not straightforward, then at least to have a balance of propriety. Too many young Davis was 20 at the time African American men go to jail in the US and disproportionately too many go to the execution cell. Race is an aggravating factor, even now, and especially in the south, even now.It's never wise to second-guess learned courts which have been through the evidence as the US supreme court African American members included has done and upheld the verdict of lower courts. Why has this case become a cause celebre when others do not? Perhaps because the weight of evidence against a safe conviction is, as Pilkington reports, so heavy. But perhaps for other reasons.Beyond dispute is the idea that appeals can drag on for 20 years. Who benefits? Mostly lawyers, I imagine, though sometimes a reprieved or acquitted defendant. There are too many lawyers in America and not enough justice, I suspect. My sense is that justice might better have been served here by commutation but American courts, like everyone else's, do not like to be told what to do by well-meaning foreigners.An eloquent example of the search for justice surfaced this week in the person of former policeman John Murray, who cradled the dying Pc Yvonne Fletcher in his arms after she was shot by unknown Libyan official(s) from their London embassy in 1984.The suspects were expediently allowed home, Blair-style, by Margaret Thatcher's government. But Murray promised his colleague he would find her killers and have them brought to justice.In liberated Libya this week, he seems to be fulfilling his pledge.Troy DavisCapital punishmentUnited StatesState of GeorgiaUS supreme courtChinaRussiaEuropeHuman Rights ActHuman rightsIranMiddle EastMichael Whiteguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Stock markets tumble after Operation Twist and doubt 
Posted: Thu, 22 Sep 2011 09:25:00 GMTPosted: 2011-09-22T14:16:23Z US Federal Reserve strategy to calm financial markets causes investor fright as markets from London to Asia plungeStock markets tumbled on Thursday and the pound slumped to a one-year low against the US dollar as investors took fright at a gloomy warning about the world economic outlook from the US central bank.The US Federal Reserve's Operation Twist its latest attempt to stimulate the American economy failed to calm financial markets. The FTSE 100 index in London plunged 266 points to 5022, a 5% drop. Other European markets also suffered heavy losses.In Asia, the Nikkei closed down 2.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbled 4.9% and the Jakarta stock market lost nearly 9%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index fell 3% in early trading, down 346 points at 10,778.The sell-off came after the Fed unveiled a $400bn (260bn) bond-buying plan on Wednesday to ward off a double-dip recession.Investors rushed to the safety of the US dollar, driving the pound down by one and a half cents to $1.5328, the lowest level since September 2010. The gold price also fell, losing almost $50 an ounce to $1,729.The City had been "left reeling" by the sharply negative tone adopted by the Fed on Wednesday night, when it warned that the US economic recovery was at risk, said Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index."The negative tone struck by the Fed in terms of the serious headwinds and downside risks facing the US economy sent a ripple through the markets," said Raymond.In Europe, the European Central Bank came under pressure to take action itself after a worsening in the services and manufacturing sectors sparked warnings that the economic recovery was definitely over. This was exacerbated by news that industrial orders in the eurozone slid for the second month in a row in July.Federal Reserve gloomThe Fed's open markets committee said the economic outlook had deteriorated sharply, noting there were "significant downside risks" to its economic forecasts and indicating that a full recovery was years away. "Recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labour market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated," it said.This drove the Dow Jones down 2.5% on Wednesday, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3%. The dollar hit a seven-month high on Thursday as investors scrambled for safety.Commodities tumbled on news that Chinese factory output had shrunk for a third month in September as flagging overseas demand put the brakes on new orders. Brent crude oil lost more than $2 to $107.50 a barrel, while US crude dropped $3 to $82.92 a barrel. Copper lost 3.3% on the London Metal Exchange, falling to a 10-month low of $8,028.75 a tonne."It is another blow after the Fed's language about downside risks on the economy really hurt sentiment," David Thurtell of Citigroup in Singapore told Reuters.The Fed's move came on same day that the Bank of England was also getting ready to pump more money into the British economy.Double twist"Operation Twist", named after a similar measure launched in the 1960s under President Kennedy, will see the Fed buying $400bn (258bn) of long-term Treasury bonds by June 2012 and selling shorter-term debts. The measure is aimed at driving down long-term interest rates across the economy, in an attempt to reduce the cost of borrowing for indebted homeowners and struggling firms.In another effort to help the ailing US housing market, the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, said that as the mortgage-backed securities it owns matured, it would reinvest the proceeds in buying new mortgage bonds. Economists called the measures a "double twist".Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income at Evolution Securities, said: "Twist and doubt? You have to hand it to the Fed. They have gone all retro on us and persuaded the market to call their latest attempt at intervention 'Operation Twist' rather than 'QE 3'. The latter might imply that the first two attempts didn't quite work out as hoped so far better to change the name."He added: "The basic idea is of course to stimulate economic growth by persuading investors into risk assets the one thing that is clear is that Mr Bernanke is prepared to use all the weapons in his armoury in order to try and ensure that the US does not enter a long period of low growth, so Operation Twist may not be the last intervention unless it works. And of course the UK is about to follow suit."Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, was not convinced Operation Twist would do much good. "The big question is whether this latest action will accomplish anything. We doubt it. Judging by the modest rally in 10-year treasury yields since the announcement, most of this was already priced in."More generally, the cost of borrowing simply isn't the problem. Businesses don't have the confidence to invest and half of all mortgage borrowers don't have the home equity needed to refinance at lower rates."Global economyStock marketsUS economyEconomicsUS economic growth and recessionInterest ratesUS Interest ratesGlobal recessionRecessionQuantitative easingFTSENikkeiDow JonesUnited StatesJapanChinaAustraliaBank of EnglandJulia Kolleweguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

David Cameron to urge world leaders to protect civilians 
Posted: Wed, 21 Sep 2011 23:04:48 GMTPosted: 2011-09-21T23:15:24Z Prime minister will use his speech at the United Nations to ask international community to act against repressive regimesDavid Cameron will issue a plea on Thursday to world leaders to be prepared to intervene again when civilians are massacred by repressive regimes as he warns that the UN is in danger of losing its nerve after the campaign in Libya.In his most wide ranging speech on foreign policy as prime minister, Cameron will declare that the UN must change its ways if it is to avoid losing the opportunity provided by the Arab spring.Speaking to the UN general assembly, Cameron will say: "You can sign every human rights declaration in the world, but if you stand by and watch people being slaughtered in their own country when you could act, then what are those signatures really worth?"The UN has to show that we can be not just united in condemnation, but united in action, acting in a way that lives up to the UN's founding principles and meets the needs of people everywhere."Britain fears that China and Russia, both of which are angry that the military action in Libya went further than envisaged, are planning to block action in the future against other states. Britain is keen to agree to tough new sanctions against Syria, where more than 2,000 people have died since the uprising against the Assad regime.Cameron will not name Moscow and Beijing, though he will make it clear that momentum is in danger of being lost when he says: "The international community has found its voice in Libya. We must not now lose our nerve. We must have the confidence to speak out and act as necessary to support those who seek new freedoms."The prime minister, who received a rapturous reception with Nicolas Sarkozy in Tripoli and Benghazi last week, arrived in New York on Wednesday bolstered by the success of the Libya campaign. He briefed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, on his visit to Libya, during a 30-minute meeting .Obama praised Cameron as "outstanding" and hailed the Anglo-American special relationship. "Obviously there is an extraordinarily special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom," the president said. "I have always found Prime Minister Cameron to be an outstanding partner, so I am very grateful for his friendship, his hard work, his dedication and his leadership on the global stage."Cameron briefed the president on his speech which will draw comparisons with Tony Blair's famous Chicago oration in April 1999. In that speech, delivered during the Kosovo campaign, the former prime minister outlined what came to be known as the doctrine of liberal interventionism.Downing Street sources stressed that Cameron has a different vision to Blair, who is in New York in his role as the Middle East peace envoy. Cameron believes Libya shows the conditions that need to be met before action is taken against repressive regimes: The UN must agree to the action Other countries in the region must be supportive in the way that the Arab League supported the no-fly zone over Libya Action must be tailored to the needs of the particular country in question.These conditions mean that the most immediate action envisaged by the prime minister against Syria will involve tougher sanctions, but not military action. Cameron will condemn the Assad regime, though he will stop short of demanding fresh sanctions."On Syria, it is time for the members of the security council to act. Of course we should always act with care when it comes to the internal affairs of a sovereign state. But we cannot allow this to be an excuse for indifference in the face of a regime that week after week arrests, intimidates, tortures and kills people who are peacefully trying to make their voices heard."Cameron said the Arab spring showed that the Palestinians have the right to live in a "viable" state. But he made clear Britain's unease with Mahmoud Abbas's plans to make a declaration of statehood when he said the focus should be on the resumption of negotiations with Israel. The prime minister, who discussed the Palestinian plans with Obama, said: "No resolution can, on its own, substitute for the political will necessary to bring peace. Peace will only come when Palestinians and Israelis sit down and talk to each other, make compromises, build trust and agree."The prime minister, who acknowledges that his premiership has been transformed by Libya, will hail the people of Tripoli and Benghazi for ensuring that their country did not join an infamous roll call of failure. "This revolution truly belongs to the Libyan people. The United Nations played a vital role authorising international action. But let's be clear, the United Nations is no more effective than the nation states that come together to enforce its will."On this occasion a coalition of nations across the Western and Arab world had the will to act. In so doing, they stopped Benghazi from joining Srebrenica and Rwanda in history's painful roll call of massacres the world failed to prevent."Cameron will outline how the Arab Spring presents a challenge to all regions, including Europe. These are, first, that Europe must show it can reform its aid and trade strategy. Britain believes that France is guilty of promoting protectionist barriers which block agricultural imports to the EU.He will also say that the African Union should "meet the opportunities of this century with the same courage that won liberation in the last". This will be seen as a dig at Jacob Zuma, the South African president, who was critical of the campaign against Muammar Gaddafi.David CameronArab and Middle East unrestLibyaMiddle EastAfricaSyriaBashar Al-AssadRussiaChinaUnited NationsTony BlairPalestinian territoriesIsraelNicholas Wattguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Chinese TV journalist murdered 
Posted: Wed, 21 Sep 2011 14:58:41 GMTPosted: 2011-09-21T14:58:41Z A Chinese TV journalist who investigated a food safety scandal has been murdered. Li Xiang, 30, was found with at least stab 10 stab wounds on Sunday night in China's Henan province. He died the following day. His laptop was missing and police believe robbery was the likely motive.However, the New York-based press watchdog, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), has called on the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough inquiry into whether the motive was related to his journalism.Local news reports and bloggers have linked Li's death to his reports on Luoyang TV on the illegal recycling of waste oil into cooking oil.Following his reports, police in Henan and two other provinces recovered 100 tons of the carcinogenic oil - called "gutter oil" because of its origins - and arrested 32 people for selling it.Food safety scandals are common in China, and journalists reporting on them frequently encounter harassment, according to CPJ research.Source: CPJJournalist safetyChinaFood safetyPress freedomRoy Greensladeguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Death penalty statistics from the US: which state executes the most people? 
Posted: Wed, 21 Sep 2011 12:30:00 GMTPosted: 2011-09-21T12:30:01Z Death penalty across the US is in the news with the case of Troy Davis. See who has been executed in the US this year and how states compare with each other Get the data 2011 world death penalty statistics data Interactive mapUS death penalty rates will be in sharp focus this week as Troy Davis faces a lethal injection in Georgia, in the most controversial case this year. But his will not be the first case this year - there have been 33 deaths so far.Capital punishment was suspended from 1972 to 1976 - when it was resurrected by the Supreme Court.Since then, 1,264 people have been executed in America. This is how it breaks down: Texas is the big state for executions - with 474 since 1976, followed by Virginia California has more inmates on death row than any other state - 721. The state has not had any executions since a 2006 moratorium but procedures are set to restart for Albert Greenwood Brown, whose execution was suspended last year. One problem is that the state's supply of sodium thiopental has expired Texas is only behind Oklahoma if you look at the rate of executions per million population Alabama has 43 defendants on death row for every million peopleSo, who gets executed? Only 12 women have been executed since 1976. However, race is always an issue in the death penalty debate and that does seem to be backed up by the recent data. If you look at who has been executed since the beginning of 2010, it looks like this:But if you look at those numbers as a proportion of US population, it's clear that more black people get executed, compared to their share of the population.Lethal injection has become the most common form of death, with some exceptions. Last year, Ronnie Lee Gardner became the first American in 14 years to be put to death by firing squad - only the third person to die by firing squad in the US since 1977.The death penalty puts the US in some interesting company: China leads the world in executions - with thousands killed in 2010, according to Amnesty International. Since Cuba stopped carrying out executions in 2003, the US has been the only country in the Americas to execute people, with the exception of St Kitts and Nevis, where one person was put to death in 2008, according to AI.We have collated statistics from AI - and the excellent Death Penalty Information Centre to show how US capital punishment breaks down across America - and we've included the latest world estimates.In the spreadsheet below you will find: US executions in 2011 and 2010 listed by person Execution rates by US state since the reintroduction of capital punishment in 1976 Executions around the world in 2010 Method of US execution - and how many have died that wayWhat can you do with the data?Data summary Download the data DATA: download the full spreadsheetMore open dataData journalism and data visualisations from the GuardianWorld government data Search the world's government data with our gatewayDevelopment and aid data Search the world's global development data with our gatewayCan you do something with this data?

Despite China's growth, its workers endure a fundamental evil | Hsiao-Hung Pai 
Posted: Tue, 20 Sep 2011 15:30:01 GMTPosted: 2011-09-20T23:06:03Z Migrants who toil in the cities still face a decades-old system of segregation and exploitation. But many are now demanding fairnessWhen I walk into Beijing's migrant worker slums, five minutes from the high-rising financial centre and shopping malls, I understand what Ai Weiwei means when he calls Beijing "a city of violence" violence against a large section of its working population and their families. "We live under the same sky, why are we not entitled to the same rights?" is a question many ask in Xinzhuang and other migrant neighbourhoods.During the past month schools for children of migrant workers who build the capital's offices and mansions, clean its streets and guard its security have been shut down, with more to follow in the coming weeks. Tens of thousands of migrant children are left without schools and nurseries to go to. Here in Beijing, two worlds exist in parallel. Those of rural origin a third of the city's 19 million population are ruthlessly segregated from the urban dwellers, economically, socially and culturally. Despite the attempt to pretend this is a local issue and only local governments are responsible, the day-to-day injustices experienced by migrants are very much a result of central policies.The system that has maintained the rural-urban segregation within China's cities is hukou (household registration), set up in 1958 to control rural-to-urban migration. While rhetorically the peasantry was the "vanguard of the revolution" and indeed the 1949 revolution wouldn't have been possible without them in practice, in China's post-1949 drive to industrialisation, the peasantry became an unchangeable category of social class in the Maoist theory of the "four blocs of society" known as "new democracy" (xinminzhu zhuyi).Peasants' role was to produce and feed the cities and support the modernisation process of their motherland. Peasants' class status was fixed as shown on their ID no matter what they might choose to do. "Wo shi nongmin [Iam a peasant]," I've had migrant workers tell me about their class origin, as if it were a stamp on your body for life. It was impossible for peasants to move their hukou to the cities.This class status hasn't changed since Deng Xiao Ping's gaige kaifang (economic reforms and opening up), in the late 1970s. The countryside underwent de-collectivisation while it remained the nation's production backyard. Agricultural production increased in the early stage of the reforms in "releasing the productive forces", as Deng called it, but with rampant corruption and heavy taxation, the poverty deepened. Since the mid-1980s half of the 400 million rural working population have been pushed off the land, seeking a livelihood away from their villages.As rural residents came to the cities, they immediately faced discrimination and exclusion. Migrant workers' first welcome was being told to stand in the min-gong (peasant worker) queue inside train stations. And there was no way to disguise class origin: the migrants could be distinguished by their brown, tanned faces and bent backs (due to years of farm work). They spoke their own dialects instead of "proper" Mandarin. Many faced verbal abuse as soon as they arrived.In the three decades of gaige kaifang, numerous barriers have been set up to discourage their migration: the strict requirement for the unaffordable temporary residency permit, and the random street search by police. Most migrants feel they are a hidden army of labour that supplies industries and urban life with their sweat and blood while enduring second-class status.Today, when China boasts growth and foreign reserves, migrants continue to be burdened with the hukou system. The criteria for applying for a hukou remain harsh, and unreachable for most migrants, and many work for years without any status. Without hukou, they can't access services in the cities such as healthcare, education and housing. While urban dwellers pay a minimal cost for medical care, many migrants have to return home for treatment. While urban children enjoy free primary education, migrants either aren't entitled or can't afford it monthly tuition fees in a Beijing primary school would cost a migrant parent two-thirds of their wages.A migrant activist told me: "These children aren't treated as everyone else. They're called the mobile students, who can't go to state schools. Their parents have for years sent their children to privately run schools without proper facilities or curriculum." InHaiding, Chaoyang and Daxing the migrant-inhabited townships within Beijing hundreds such private schools were set up. Some are run as makeshift charities, others profit-making, but they are inadequate to provide proper education. Yet education, in many people's eyes, is the only way they can lift themselves out of poverty.Some call hukou the fundamental evil. Even the government-funded National Development and Reform Commission admits it is an "institutional barrier" and believes it should be scrapped. However, these institutions aren't in the position to change things. "Protection of migrant workers' rights" is a rhetorical statement of state organisations, but the government has shown no wish to listen to migrant workers' demands. The only officially recognised channel through which migrant workers can voice their discontent is by petitioning the local authorities a centuries-old tradition. Little happens as a result. Self-organised protests are classified as "mass incidents" and often dispersed quickly.Calls for change have so far fallen on deaf ears. Some suspect that migrant children's schools are being closed as a disincentive to future migration. Migrant workers' NGOs face constant government monitoring and pressure not to speak out. Meanwhile, the state-run trade unions are ineffective and seen by many workers as a "paper tiger".In recent years, migrants have raised their demands through protests, road blockages, sit-ins and spontaneous strikes. Although these have not always proved effective, workers have become more aware of their collective strength. In the past year they have won some improvements in wages and working conditions. Many migrant workers, now better informed, are far less willing to accept the status quo. As they grow in confidence, the regime will find it increasingly difficult to ignore their demands. China's rulers should realise now that it is in their long-term interests to listen.ChinaHsiao-Hung Paiguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Japan anxious over defence data as China denies hacking weapons maker 
Posted: Tue, 20 Sep 2011 13:42:09 GMTPosted: 2011-09-20T13:47:19Z Cyberattack at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries worries Tokyo as it keeps information on submarines, missiles and fighter jetsChina has angrily denied suggestions that it was behind a hacking attack targeting Japan's biggest weapons contractor.Dozens of the firm's computers were infected in what reports suggested was a co-ordinated attack on Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which may have resulted in the leak of sensitive defence information.The company, whose military inventory includes submarines, US-designed F-15 fighter jets and surface-to-air Patriot missiles, said that only network information and IP addresses might have fallen into the hackers' hands.A spokesman for the firm confirmed that 83 computers and servers at 11 locations, including Mitsubishi Heavy's headquarters in Tokyo and shipyards in Nagasaki and Kobe, had been accessed.Speculation that hackers in China were responsible grew after media reports said Chinese characters had been detected in the attack. But Hong Lei, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters: "The Chinese government has consistently opposed hacking activities. The law strictly prohibits this."China is one of the main victims of hacking criticising China as being the source of the hacking attacks is not only baseless, it is also not beneficial for promoting international co-operation for internet security."Mitsubishi Heavy was criticised for failing to report the attack, and could face serious financial repercussions if a police investigation reveals that military secrets were divulged.Under its agreement with the Tokyo government, the company is required to immediately inform authorities of any suspected breach of sensitive or classified information.Defence officials were reportedly furious after learning of the attacks through recent media reports, about a month after they took place."It is up to the defence ministry to decide whether or not the information is important," Professor Yoshiyasu Takefuji, a cybersecurity expert at Keio University in Tokyo, told Reuters.Takefuji said the breach, the first of its kind involving a Japanese defence firm, had exposed the country's poor state of readiness for cyber-warfare. "This happened a month ago, and it's just in the last few days they realised how bad it was," he said. "They've been dozing for the past month."Any leak of classified information could result in large fines for Mitsubishi Heavy, which earns a tenth of its revenue from government contracts, often in partnership with US firms such as Lockheed Martin.The defence minister, Yasuo Ichikawa, said that he was not aware that any important information had been leaked.Last year, the ministry awarded Mitsubishi 215 contracts worth a combined 260bn yen (2.1bn), equivalent to almost a quarter of its annual expenditure. "We are not aware of any important data being leaked," he said. "The ministry has business ties with the company, so we will instruct it to review its information control systems."On Monday night, Japanese media reported that the scandal may escalate after IHI, which builds engine parts for fighter planes, had fallen victim to similar attacks. The Kyodo news agency reported that the websites of several government agencies had been attacked over the weekend.The national police agency said recent online message boards in China had encouraged hackers to disrupt Japanese websites ahead of the 80th anniversary on Sunday of the Mukden incident, an explosion staged by the imperial Japanese army that led to its invasion of China.JapanCybercrimeArms tradeHackingChinaComputingJustin McCurryguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Ashdown paints picture of tough future for Britain and the west | Michael White 
Posted: Tue, 20 Sep 2011 10:42:12 GMTPosted: 2011-09-20T10:50:14Z Former Lib Dem leader says 'discontinuities' in the world will require potentially 'terrifying and dangerous adjustment' to global structuresAmid all the ritual navel gazing of a party conference, there wasn't much coverage of Paddy Ashdown's gloomy prognosis, not just for Britain, but for the wider west. If he's even half right (and he probably is), it will put the coalition's manoeuvres and Ed Miliband's finer points of policy reform into the sort of shade from which no traveller returns, even in Essex.What was he on about? Speaking on the panel at the Guardian's annual fringe debate (Allegra Stratton reports the domestic politics here), Ashdown fretted about the growing number of "discontinuities" in the world today, which will require a potentially "terrifying and dangerous adjustment" to global structures in order to realign "what we think the world is like to what the world is actually like."What did he mean? Well, that the UN is meant to be running all sorts of global activities, but is increasingly marginalised because it is structured around the world as it was in the late 1940s after the defeat of Germany and Japan.He meant that the US is still seen as the world's great economic and military power, but is increasingly in financial hock to China. That Europe is regarded as the world's No 2 economic power, but is actually in debt and confusion.I'm sure you get the picture. I bang on about such incongruities here all the time, so it was good to hear his Paddyship doing the same on a public platform. Only the Lib Dems have the courage to preach such truths to power, he insisted, among other speakers at the Birmingham conference making similar points about the party's role in the coalition.These necessary readjustments are not simply within the western sphere, US and Europe across the north Atlantic. They mark the end of a 400-year western hegemony since the decline of the Muslim Ottoman empire on Europe's eastern flank, he said, though he could have added the decay of Ming China (no relation to Ming Campbell), which too many people take for granted.India and China are returning to the centre of the world stage "if we can't see that, we are bloody fools" he told a 700-strong lunchtime audience and we can no longer assume that the US will be "our friend of last resort", there to rescue us from ourselves as it did twice in the 20th century. Yes to that.The US is increasingly preoccupied with the Chinese challenge in the Pacific. It has a Pacific-born president. Who has the biggest naval presence tackling Somali piracy in the Indian Ocean, he asked? Why, China it's a mercantilist power and needs to keep its sea lanes open for trade, as Britain once did.Quite so. When Britannia ruled the waves, many pirates were Chinese. No longer. Their pirates now wear suits and come ashore to take our wealth quite legally. They are busy buying EU companies and sovereign debt at good prices, as the US once did.Counterintuitively, you may feel in view of the eurozone turbulence, Ashdown a former diplomat, ex-special services squaddie and, later, Lib Dem leader thinks the correct British response should be closer integration with Europe. Far from apologising for their pro-euro enthusiasm, the Lib Dems should become "even more pro-European" than they are already.Why so? Because a newly-assertive Russia, rich on oil and gas, is moving menacingly to reestablish its sphere of influence, lost when the Soviet bloc collapsed after 1989, and seeks to destablise or even break up the EU. Fanciful? I'd say not.I remain wary of this sort of integrationist talk it's very difficult, for one thing but not half as wary as I am about demands on the Tory right that the eurozone's weakness is David Cameron's cue to demand fresh concessions from Brussels or even (according to yesterday's Telegraph) a referendum on British EU membership. Admittedly, that demand came from Mark Pritchard MP, a nice fellow but not the sharpest pencil in the box.Pritchard called the EU "an occupying force", which shows he doesn't quite get what that phrase means.All EU member states except Britain and Sweden were subject to domestic tyranny or foreign occupation (some more than once) in the 20th century. They know the difference, as Pritchard evidently does not. A resumption of beggar-my-neighbour protectionism is increasingly on the cards. Scary stuff, though not all Lib Dems think so (Chris Huhne is cheerful), and the party conference's tone is curiously upbeat.Ashdown admits that, as party leader, he hopelessly lost the battle to shape public opinion in a pro-EU direction. Indeed he did. So it was fascinating to hear Nick Clegg make a determined effort not to abandon the pro-European standard when he popped up on Radio 4's Today programme at breakfast time. The tireless Andy Sparrow covers it in his conference live blog, beginning at around 8.30am.The DPM said he wasn't still advocating British membership of the eurozone. He ruled it out for the current parliament (2010-15), but wouldn't go further than that. No one predicted what would happen, he insisted which isn't true. At the time, pro-euro advocates dismissed the idea that weak southern EU members, including Italy, would be allowed to join. "You can't have a currency without a state," critics said.But Clegg was on firmer ground when he said Germany and Italy were to blame for abandoning the rules of their own stability pact, which was meant to discipline sovereign borrowing to no more than 3% of GDP if I recall. Nor should debt be above 60% yet Italy's was 115% when it joined. That's roughly what it remains, incidentally."My own view remains that if the disciplines and they were strict fiscal disciplines on which the euro was originally launched had been respected and adhered to, the euro would not now be in the trouble that it is," Clegg said.I'm not persuaded, but it's a courageous stance to take when others are diving off the EU boat. He deserves some credit but he won't get it.Liberal Democrat conference 2011Liberal Democrat conferencePaddy AshdownChinaMichael Whiteguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Himalayan quake: helicopters drop supplies to remote villages 
Posted: Tue, 20 Sep 2011 09:52:28 GMTPosted: 2011-09-20T10:02:19Z Soldiers attempt to clear mud with heavy machinery and reach settlements in mountainous regionHelicopters have dropped emergency supplies to the Himalayan villages worst-hit by the earthquake that has killed at least 81 people in India, Nepal and China, while earthmovers pushed through debris clogging nearby valleys.Soldiers in the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim cleared a path to Mangan, one of the towns closest to the epicentre of Sunday's 6.9-magnitude quake, but many other communities remained cut off and authorities fear the death toll will rise once rescuers reach them.Indian army helicopters ferried rescuers and dropped food and supplies to still-inaccessible villages in Sikkim, a sparsely populated and almost entirely mountainous region that was an independent protectorate before becoming an Indian state in 1975. It borders Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Chinese region of Tibet.The quake killed at least 50 people in Sikkim, said the state's top official, Karma Gyatso.India's home secretary, RK Singh, told reporters that 12 people had been killed in West Bengal and six others in Bihar state. Authorities in neighboring Nepal reported six deaths, while China's official Xinhua news agency reported seven deaths in Tibet.Army helicopters were still conducting aerial surveys of the quake zone, though local authorities have already reported extensive damage to homes and buildings across Sikkim, Gyatso said.In Nepal, officials said six people had been killed when houses collapsed near the capital, Kathmandu, bringing down an earlier figure of seven deaths due to the quake.The region has been hit by major earthquakes in the past, including in 1950 and 1897.IndiaNatural disasters and extreme weatherNepalTibetChinaguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Obama's envoy for climate change casts doubt on Kyoto protocol 
Posted: Mon, 19 Sep 2011 20:38:22 GMTPosted: 2011-09-21T10:41:55Z Todd Stern hints progress at climate talks in South Africa may stall with insistence on limits on greenhouse gas emissionsPresident Barack Obama's chief climate change negotiator has issued a warning over the future of the Kyoto protocol, casting doubt on a key plank of international climate talks this December in South Africa.Todd Stern, the US president's envoy for climate change, said the European Union was the only remaining "major player" that would potentially support a continuation of the protocol after its provisions expire in 2012. The lack of support from other countries bodes ill for the forthcoming talks at Durban.The Kyoto protocol is an international agreement that imposes limits on the greenhouse gas emissions from some signatory countries that was negotiated in the Japanese city of Kyoto in 1997.Kyoto is the only treaty which binds nearly all of the world's industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions but Stern cast doubt on its future."Of the major players in the Kyoto protocol, my sense is that the EU is the only one still considering signing up in some fashion to a second commitment period. Japan is clearly not, Russia is not, Canada is not and Australia appears unlikely."His words were the broadest hint yet by one of the most influential figures at the talks that the negotiations may stall unless the Kyoto protocol is dropped.Behind the scenes, many experts are advising that arguments over the future of the protocol are likely to be fruitless. Sir David King, the British government's former chief scientific advisor, told the Guardian recently that the protocol should be dropped, as it was only an impediment to reaching a new international agreement on averting global warming.The future of the protocol is a key question at the United Nations climate negotiations, because most big developing countries have stipulated that the 1997 treaty must be continued as a condition of any future climate change agreement.Those developing countries are furious that rich countries are thinking of dumping the hard-fought protocol, which they insist must be the foundation of any future agreement.Disagreement between developed and developing countries on whether to ditch the protocol was one of the biggest reasons why the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 failed to reach a clear conclusion.The US does not take part in Kyoto protocol discussions, because it has never ratified the treaty and the current administration has followed its predecessor in vowing not to do so.However, as the chief climate change negotiator for the world's biggest economy, Stern's views carry enormous weight in the debate on possible future international measures."The Kyoto protocol is one of the toughest if not the toughest part of the negotiations," Stern admitted. "The US is not part [of those discussions] but what happens to [the protocol] is relevant to whether there will be understandings on future regimes [and these] are still controversial and difficult subjects."He said that the US had participated, in recent days, in international "conversations about future regimes" on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and the question of whether there should be a single global regime on cutting emissions or one that could run concurrently with a continuation of the Kyoto protocol. Other issues discussed included whether any future regime should be legally binding.However, Stern said there had been no discussions on trying to find a way forward among a smaller number of countries, outside the UN process. Some countries have privately criticised the UN process for the unwieldy and bureaucratic nature of its negotiations.Stern warned that the US would not countenance a new climate regime that contained "escape hatches" for some countries, and hinted that countries now labelled as "developing" should be drawn into taking on obligations on emissions."It could not be on the basis of categories of countries that were articulated in 1992 [when the parent treaty to the Kyoto protocol was signed]," he said. In that parent treaty, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to which the US is a signatory, economies such as China, India and Brazil were judged to be developing and thus escaped obligations to cut their emissions.However, the rapid growth of these economies in the past two decades has changed the international scene, in the US view.Stern's words were an indication that big emerging economies such as China the world's second biggest economy by output must take on legally binding obligations if the US were also to consider doing so.At the negotiations in Copenhagen and last year in Cancun, China, India and a few other big emerging economies agreed to curbs on the future growth of their emissions but fell short of pledging absolute reductions, and the resulting agreements do not have the legal status of a fully articulated treaty like the Kyoto protocol.Stern insisted that he was "not pessimistic" about the prospect of important progress being made at Durban towards a new international agreement on climate.No one expects that any significant new agreement will be signed this year. There will be another, bigger conference at the end of next year in Rio de Janeiro. This article was amended on 20 and 21 September 2011. The original said the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change judged the economies of China, India and Brazil as "developed". This has been corrected. It also referred to some signee countries.

Rescue effort continues after Himalayan earthquake kills dozens 
Posted: Mon, 19 Sep 2011 17:44:37 GMTPosted: 2011-09-20T00:40:32Z Heavy rain and thick cloud hamper relief operations after more than 100,000 homes in India, Nepal and Tibet were hitRescuers are battling heavy rain and thick cloud as they try to reach villages cut off by mudslides after a powerful earthquake killed at least 63 people and damaged more than 100,000 homes in India, Nepal and Tibet.Thousands of soldiers and rescue workers continued to pull victims from rubble as the number of deaths climbed to 35 in the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim, site of the epicentre of the 6.9-magnitude quake that rattled through the Himalayas on Sunday night.Thick cloud prevented helicopters from flying over parts of the affected areas, but some mountain passes blocked by landslides had been reopened, police said."The earthquake has loosened the hill faces, and when it rains it causes landslides. So the situation is still very dangerous," said Deepak Pandey, a spokesman for the Indo-Tibetan border police. More than 400 people had been rescued overnight, he said, including some in the worst-hit area of Pegong in the north.Although it may take days for the final number of fatalities to be confirmed, border police said they did not think the death toll would rise significantly.More than 6,000 troops have been drafted in to clear concrete slabs, bricks and mud and reach scores of people trapped under collapsed houses.India's home secretary, Raj Kumar Singh, said that airforce helicopters had dropped food to villages, airlifted a medical team, evacuated the injured and conducted damage assessments. Heavy construction equipment had also been used to clear some of the blocked roads."The rescue and relief operations are in full swing, though they were hampered by poor weather," he said, "[but] there may still be villages where people are trapped under collapsed houses that we have not been able to reach."Singh said that at least 10 of those who died in Sikkim worked for the same hydroelectric project. At least 13 other people were killed in the neighbouring Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal, he added. Eight people died in Nepal, and China's official Xinhua news agency reported seven deaths in Tibet.Most of the deaths occurred when houses already weakened from recent monsoon rains collapsed because of the force of the quake.By midday on Monday, workers had managed to clear landslides from one lane of the main highway connecting Sikkim with the rest of India, and an initial convoy of 75 paramilitaries had started moving toward Mangan, the village closest to the quake's epicentre, officials said.In Gangtok, Sikkim's capital, 42 miles south-east of the epicentre, police said they had cordoned off the office of the state's top elected official after the building was severely damaged. TV footage showed buckled buildings, cracked pavements and two major roads collapsed. Shops, businesses and offices were closed in the town and neighbouring settlements, and many areas remained without electricity. Water supplies were scarce because of burst pipes and telephone communication was patchy.Nepal's government said at least eight people died there, including two men and a child who were killed when part of the perimeter wall of the British embassy compound in Kathmandu collapsed. A spokesman for the UK Foreign Office confirmed the incident, adding that it "deeply regrets" the death of the three Nepali citizens and the injuries to others."The ambassador met with and offered his condolences to the local community on Sunday evening and met with relatives of the victims on Monday[yesterday] morning," he said. "The embassy will continue to do everything possible to help the local community and the government of Nepal."In West Bengal, utility workers toiled through the night to restore power to a large swath of the state which plunged into darkness after power lines were snapped.The earthquake, which was followed by several aftershocks, was felt as far away as the Indian capital. An official from the UN's disaster management team in New Delhi said that humanitarian assistance would still be needed even if casualties turned out to be low, as people who lost their homes would need food and shelter.The region has been hit by major earthquakes in the past, including in 1950 and 1897.Natural disasters and extreme weatherChinaIndiaNepalTibetSam Jonesguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

China's boom in 'citizen candidates' sparks backlash 
Posted: Mon, 19 Sep 2011 15:36:26 GMTPosted: 2011-09-20T01:17:42Z Social media is helping growing numbers of activists campaign in low-level local polls and the authorities are fighting backAs electoral agendas go, they may not seem terribly radical: Yang Lingyun, a 40-year Communist party stalwart, worries about her messy housing estate. Zheng Wei wants to help residents struggling with a switch in energy providers.But the two women's modest manifestos have been enough to land them in trouble with the authorities, like many more Chinese citizens seeking to stand in local elections. Beijing police detained them and 10 more would-be candidates for several hours on Friday, after they met to discuss the capital's forthcoming poll. Voting is not an activity most people associate with China. But every five years citizens have the chance to pick their representative for local people's congresses, the lowest bodies in the tiered parliamentary system and the only ones determined by direct elections.The 2m places are usually claimed by carefully vetted candidates, but in theory anyone can stand if 10 constituents back them. While Beijing has a handful of independent representatives, Yang, Zheng and their friends are part of a surge of people seeking to use this law in the new election season, which began this summer and runs until next year. Li Fan, of the World and China Institute thinktank, estimates there are tens of thousands of "citizen candidates" this time. "Firstly, people's civic and rights awareness has been enhanced," he said. "Secondly, the relationship between the state and government is worse than before. People dealing with issues like rights protection, layoffs and housing don't have other methods thirdly, Weibo [China's Twitter-like microblog service] plays an important role.""In 2006 media were not allowed to report [on independent candidates]. This year there is social media, providing a platform for people to communicate thoughts, exchange ideas and support each other."Would-be representatives are posting messages on Weibo, uploading videos, even producing campaign T-shirts. Zheng and her friends have natty red sashes and a large banner that says: "Honoured to take part in the election for the people's congress". But their zeal has been matched by official attempts to impede them. Despite Friday's detentions, Beijing is considered one of the more tolerant areas. Authorities in other places have used technicalities to disqualify would-be candidates, have threatened nominators and have harassed those seeking to stand.The law states that local election committees must "confirm" candidates; many have simply been omitted from the final list of names.Liu Ping, a labour activist in eastern Jiangxi province, was detained at a hotel until the poll had passed. In Hangzhou, Xu Yan quit his job but stayed in the race when tax officials began investigating his employers. In Guangzhou, Liang Shuxin a male party member was suddenly told only female non-communists could stand. Though the rule was subsequently withdrawn, he did not appear on the candidate list.Many of these people are long-term activists and some see making the elections meaningful as a possible stepping stone to wider changes in China's political system. But for the most part, their aims are notably restrained. The Beijing group talks of supporting isolated old people, improving relations between neighbours and making sure young children have nursery places."They are not really independent candidates in the sense of partisan politics. They are simply citizens who are running of their own accord and want to truly represent the people," said Dr Yawei Liu of the Carter Centre's China programme.Local congresses are largely rubber-stamp bodies, but Liu pointed out that powers such as approving budgets were potentially important."If there are enough of these candidates around they will be able to hold the government accountable. Hence, there seem to be efforts to prevent them from running," he said.Others think the authorities fear independent representatives could encourage growing assertiveness among the public in general.The increased pressure appears to be counterproductive in many cases. Liu Ping's detention prompted others to launch their own campaigns. Zheng Wei wants to sue police for detaining her on Friday and still plans to stand for election. "Every time I went to register they told me to wait at home and they would come to register me, but so far no one has come," she said. "Our previous experience of rights protection has been filled with trouble, but we strengthen our determination in the face of difficulties."ChinaHuman rightsSocial mediaSocial networkingTania Braniganguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Beer company threatens Tibetan antelope 
Posted: Mon, 19 Sep 2011 10:52:41 GMTPosted: 2011-09-19T13:54:37Z Snow Beer is offering customers an expedition to the Tibetan Plateau that is supposedly off-limits to everyone except scientistsA promotion for the world's best-selling beer encroaches on the protected breeding ground of the Tibetan antelope, according to Chinese conservationists who are campaigning against the commercial exploitation of one of the planet's most unique nature reserves.Snow Beer which is partly owned by the London-based SABMiller brewery company is offering its customers an expedition to Kekexili, a remote region high on the Tibetan Plateau that is supposed to be off-limits to everyone except scientists with permission from the national government.Marketing officials have said the tour part of the company's annual "Challenging the World" promotion will lift the veil on the "No Human zone" in Kekexili and promote environmental awareness. Participants are now being selected for a scheduled trip in October, but conservation groups are opposed on the grounds that it could encourage other companies and tour groups to enter a region that is famed for a dramatic conservation success story.Kekexili also known as Hoh Xil is one of the least populated areas on earth. It has been a national reserve since 1995, but for many years after it was the site of a murderous conflict between poachers and the Wild Yak Brigade, a patrol of vigilantes committed to protecting endangered species.Chief among them was the chiru, or Tibetan antelope, which was almost hunted to extinction due to the demand of wealthy foreign consumers for its fine shahtoosh wool. A gritty 2004 film about their plight and the killing of the brigade's leader prompted the government to strengthen protection. Chiru numbers have since started to recover and the animal was made a mascot for the Beijing Olympics.Conservationists say the brewery's proposed tour would be a setback."This is China's most precious nature reserve. There are explicit prohibitions against crossings," said Wu Zhu, the conservationist heading the campaign against the promotion tour. "It has a 'No Human Zone', which as the name implies, is not supposed to be visited by anyone, yet Snow have gone ahead with their promotion even before they have permission."The managers of Kekexili Natural Reserve said Snow Beer has requested permission to enter the region, but no approval has been granted. "We haven't decided whether to allow them to cross the outer band of the reserve, but they will definitely not be permitted to enter the core or buffer areas," said the director of the administration bureau, who gave only his surname, Wang.There have been previous transgressions. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has reportedly brought businessmen to the area in the name of research, Ericcson is said to have taken in high-end clients and the Comfort Travel Agency in Shandong has offered trips for photographers."We have not paid enough attention in the past, but this time we will closely follow Snow," said Zhu.The brewery is easier to target as it has strong brand and controls a fifth of the Chinese market. Thanks to the surging Chinese economy, Snow overtook Budweiser in 2008 as the world's most popular beer and now sells over 16bn pints a year. Other conservationists said there was a problem of social injustice if wealthy companies and individuals were allowed to buy their way into protected areas, though they did not rule out all human activity in the region."We have to consider whether visits are useful for overall conservation. In this case, Snow are only engaged in public relations. This is motivated purely by commercial interests," said Feng Yongfeng, of the Green Beagle NGO.Snow Beer did not respond to the Guardian's questions. The company was quoted as telling the Global Times that its aim was to raise public awareness about Kekexili, "remove the mysterious mask of the uninhabited area" and "advocate the pioneer spirit of our brand".

Busan conference offers chance to tackle aid effectiveness | Jonathan Glennie 
Posted: Mon, 19 Sep 2011 06:00:01 GMTPosted: 2011-09-19T06:00:01Z The time is right for a bold attempt to draw all countries together behind clear principles on aid, which could mean giving the OECD and UN a dual role in enforcing themThe fourth High Level Forum (HLF4) on Aid Effectiveness looks set to be a huge conference, with 2,000 delegates expected from all ends of the earth. It needs to have a huge impact to be worth the effort and money invested. After many months of uncertainty a consensus is beginning to emerge about what that impact might be: a "twin-track" approach.On the one hand, the principles agreed in Paris six years ago to cover aid from OECD countries (known as overseas development assistance, or ODA) need to be re-emphasised. Progress has been slow, especially among donor countries, but there has been progress nonetheless. The principles are not perfect, but they are better than nothing.The existence of a monitoring bureaucracy, however flawed the indicators being monitored, has led to improvements in aid efficiency in many countries and, crucially, a new tone to the relationships between donor and recipient. Recipient countries are demanding more, and donors are under pressure to comply. In return, recipient countries are improving aid and budget management.But there is a second area of work that needs to be tackled head-on if it is to be relevant at the forum in Busan, South Korea, in November. The rise of the emerging powers, such as China and the other BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia and India), has challenged traditional concepts of "aid". As recently as 2005, when the Paris Declaration was signed, the magnitude of the shift occurring in the sources and types of development finance (public, private and blended) was not fully appreciated. Today, it is impossible to fail to factor it in. In some poor countries China is now the major source of development finance.The overriding weakness of the Paris Declaration is that it does not cover non-OECD official assistance providers and other development finance sources. The Paris Principles are not, as is sometimes thought, a blueprint for an ideal aid relationship. They were useful correctives to the specific aid activities of most development assistance committee (DAC) members, and continue to be so.But they are not appropriate for other sources of funding. China, for example, has little interest in untying aid, with 40% of its aid delivered as a finished product (for example, a fully built road). The resurgence of interest in south-south co-operation gives us clues as to how aid will look in the coming era, with mutual interest replacing apparent charity as the prime motive.The coming era of development will not be defined by traditional aid. By seeking principles that can govern all finance flows, even eventually private ones, the world moves beyond esoteric debates about whether flows, such as climate finance, non-ODA (pdf) official flows and complex blends of private-public flows, should be treated as aid or not.That is why Andrew Rogerson and I have published a short opinion piece for the Overseas Development Institute, arguing that global reach is the most important prize at Busan. The Busan meeting's main objective should be to reach global agreement on a few basic principles to govern all major forms of development finance. These principles should primarily be signed by all countries, international finance institutions and philanthropic organisations (including NGOs). Private sector umbrella bodies should also be encouraged to sign.The risk of expanding the mandate to all flows is that traditional donors take their eyes off the ball with regard specifically to aid effectiveness. Conversely, Paris failed to link aid effectiveness principles to concrete development outcomes, and to capture the key political changes in a fast-changing world.A focus on basic principles of development finance is a happy medium, broad enough to bring on board new players in a new global partnership, but specific enough to be meaningful.Voluntary principles are not exactly the most exciting weapons in the international development armoury. Observed as much in their circumvention as in their fulfilment, they are painfully ineffective at creating the kind of rapid improvements most of us want to see. But they are often the best we can do, given the reluctance of powerful entities to submit to binding approaches. And they often set the tone of an era. We recognise the limits of what voluntary principles can achieve, but believe they will help nudge development financers towards better practices.These principles should be applicable to all cross-border flows (as long as there is an entity that can sign up to them), unambiguously positive for development (ie it is inconceivable that development outcomes could be improved through reduced adherence), and measurable, preferably quantitatively.Once principles have been broadly agreed, further work can be done, by institutions that have a broad-based mandate, to make them technically applicable. Other principles (covering traditional ODA, climate finance, responsible investment, extractive industries and many more types of finance) will remain intact, as subsets of these overarching principles.The time is right for a bold attempt to draw all countries together behind clear principles that matter for development finance. Increasingly those responsible for the organisation of Busan are agreeing that this "twin-track" approach is the best way forward. The OECD DAC would remain the enforcer of the Paris principles covering DAC aid. But the UN would increasingly take on the role of encouraging the take up of the broader principles by all countries.If Busan flunks it and fails to grapple with this broader agenda it will still be playing out the endgame of a previous era, rather than defining the new one.AidChinaSouth KoreaJonathan Glennieguardian.co.uk 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Flood Season Claims 1,292 Lives 
Natural disasters have affected more than 210 million people in China this flood season, around one sixth of the population, according to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters on Saturday. Floods and landslides have killed 1,292 people and left another 332 missing, a senior official said, adding that crops on at least 15.43 million hectares of farmland have been destroyed and 1.22 million houses ruined. Direct economic losses were estimated to have amounted to 155.8 billion yuan (US$19.3 billion), Xinhua quoted Vice-Minister of Water Resources E Jingping as saying. E said that this season, the Pearl River basin, the Min River in Fujian, the mainstream of the Huai River, and the Hun River and Taizi River of the Liao River basin have been swept by serious floods. The middle and downstream of Xijiang River in the Pearl River basin suffered a disastrous flood, and Hunan and Heilongjiang were hit by serious mountain torrents, mud-rock flows and landslides. The hardest-hit areas include the provinces of Fujian, Anhui, Zhejiang and Hainan in southern and eastern China, which have also been plagued by seven typhoons and cyclones that claimed 221 lives. The figures were released as east China recovered from Typhoon Longwang, which left at least 95 people dead. Eighty of them were police cadets swept away in a landslide in Fujian. According to the flood-control authority, this year's major flooding period is drawing to a close. However, continued heavy rainfall during the National Day holiday has caused the biggest flood in a decade along the lower reaches of the Weihe River and the middle reaches of the Hanjiang River in Shaanxi and Hubei provinces. Sections of the rivers running through Shaanxi in northwest China overflowed, forcing 359,000 people to be evacuated. More than 4.6 million people in 61 counties were affected by floods and mud slides, which ruined 79,800 hectares of crops and destroyed 39,200 houses. Floodwaters also damaged railways, highways, cable lines and irrigation infrastructure in the province. About 30,000 people have been mobilized to reinforce embankments. But the flood gradually receded as the water level fell below warning levels late on Thursday, Xinhua reported. Central China's Hubei was also dealing with torrential rains and the threat of widespread floods. The water level in the middle reaches of the Hanjiang River has risen above the danger mark. Some 20,000 people were toiling to shore up embankments and watch for breaches. The peak of the flood were expected to hit Xiantao, a city near the provincial capital Wuhan, on Friday night. Floods have always been part of life in China, although officials have said this year has been more devastating than usual, starting early from mid-February, instead of generally from May to October. Since serious flooding of the Yangtze River in 1998, China has spent billions on flood mitigation. Water authorities have set a target for overcoming natural disasters during the period of the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-10), said Wang Shucheng, minister of water resources. In the following five years, the ministry will further reinforce flood-control systems with the operation of frequently used flood detention basins. These will protect against damage and enable floodwaters to be used as a resource, Wang said. (China Daily October 8, 2005)

Flooding Forces Huge Evacuation in Shaanxi 
About 286,000 have been evacuated from flood-hit regions in Shaanxi Province in northwest China along the banks of tributaries of the Yangtze River and Yellow River, the country's top two rivers. The provincial civil affairs department said that a total of 3.16 million people in the province have been affected by the floods along the Hanjiang River, tributary of the Yangtze River and Weihe River, tributary of the Yellow River. More than 45 counties in the province have been hit by the flood caused by continuous rainfall since late September. The flood in the Weihe River is said to be the most severe since 1981. Meanwhile, people in east China's Fujian Province have started reconstruction work following Typhoon Longwang, which claimed 65 lives and left 36 missing. Longwang, which landed in Fujian Sunday night and swept over the province for 10 hours, destroyed 5,500 houses, affected the normal lives of 3.71 million people, forced 186 highways in the province to close and 2,125 enterprises to stop production. In an effort to speed up the reconstruction work, the local government held emergency meetings and sent special working teams to different places to provide disaster relief. So far, almost all the telecommunication cables and stations damaged by Longwang have been restored thanks to timely repair work by local departments. Most of the scenic spots, roads and railways in the province have reopened. By yesterday, over 200,000 people had been evacuated to safe places and traffic in Fuzhou, capital of the province, had returned to normal. Walls of almost 50 schools in Fuzhou collapsed during the disaster, and local educational department organized rescue work to ensure students' safety. World disaster report Information is as vital as water, food, shelter and medicines when it comes to saving lives in disaster zones, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in its latest report. In the report released on Wednesday which covers drought and famine, floods, earthquakes, storms and other disasters the federation said that 250,000 people died in 2004 in 719 separate catastrophes. The number was far higher than annual average of 67,000 logged from 1994 to 2003 because of the December 26 tsunami. That disaster claimed 225,000 lives alone. At least 146 million people were affected by disasters, some 110 million of them by flooding in Bangladesh, India and China. Information is "a crucial yet often intangible need," said the federation's Chief of Operations Susan Johnson, as she launched its annual World Disasters Report. "It's been proven again and again that good information can save lives," she said. Total estimated damage worldwide was between US$100 billion and US$145 billion. Hi-tech warning systems are important, but do not stand alone, said the report's editor Jonathan Walter. "We have to build a culture of public awareness," he said. The federation pointed to the case of an Indian fisherman's son who lived in Singapore and called his family back home to tell them the December 26 tsunami was on its way after seeing television news reports, saving 3,600 lives. At the same time, scientists in the region were able to track the tsunami across the Indian Ocean, but lacked channels to inform enough people in threatened areas. (China Daily October 8, 2005)

Cage Fighting Kids 
September 22, 2011 4:59 PM - Written by 
Colin Brazier 
 The NSPCC and police want us to worry about cage-fighting kids.On the face of it - they have to be right - don't they?You'd be compelled to say - at first glance - that putting eight-year-olds into an enclosed ring and letting them hit seven bells out of one another has to be barbaric: the hallmark of an increasingly amoral society.But look deeper.The kids are not allowed to punch or kick, as they would if adults. The bout is not a fight to the knockout - both boys are declared winners....

Bring Back The Cane! 
September 17, 2011 3:04 PM - Written by 
Colin Brazier 
 Like National Service, calls to Bring Back The Cane have an intoxicating effect on some.I am not one of them. When you peel back the complexities, such ideas - when tested - are rarely indestructible.That does not mean they should not be the subject of debate. Nor is there anything dishonourable about championing such proposals. They are certainly popular.And how. A big survey has shown this weekend that half of parents would support a return to corporal punishment for the worst behaved kids....

Doing The Dirty In Starbucks 
September 14, 2011 7:00 PM - Written by 
Colin Brazier 
So there I was minding my own business. It was the upstairs bit of Starbucks in one of our cathedral cities. A few metres from me sat three fellow-customers. Two young women and an older man. He was well-dressed and, judging by his spiel - a silver-tongued sheister of some talent.For legal reasons I should probably avoid specifics. But, suffice to say, in the time it took to drain my latte,...

 Last month Sky interviewed a 16-year-old looter. Asked why he'd stolen he replied: "For my son". Pressed by an incredulous reporter, he admitted to being little more than a boy himself. He was 16.On one level, while abhorring the crime, it is possible to admire his paternal solicitude. Want to care for your baby son mate - good on yer.But on another level, on the level where real life exists, this young man was talking out of his tush. The statistics,...

Nurses Who Can't Speak English 
September 09, 2011 8:49 AM - Written by 
Colin Brazier 
My mother worked as a nurse and she saw, in the latter stages of her career, a drift away from the idea of nursing as a vocation: a 'calling' to care for others.Instead it was becoming a profession with degrees to pass, rungs on the ladder, boxes to tick, backsides to kiss. Patients became secondary, an occupational hazard, rather than the be all and end all....

Sending Sick Kids To School 
September 08, 2011 8:44 AM - Written by 
Colin Brazier 
Working parents regularly send sick children to school because they dare not take time off work to look after them.So says a survey of 2,000 mothers polled by Haliborange, a company which makes dietary supplements. It claimed four out of ten working mums had sent their child to school even though their child really required caring for at home.Another study this week paints a similarly bleak picture for parents....

Who was the first man to travel at 1,000 miles per hour?His name was Peter Twiss, who died this week at 90. He did not just break airspeed milestones - he utterly shattered them.In 1956 he flew a Fairey Delta 2 at 1,132 miles per hour. The previous record was 822 mph.The plane had a cockpit which lowered by ten degrees for take-off and landings. The innovation made Concorde possible.I recommend that you use google images to find some pictures of this remarkable aircraft....

On the night Diana died, fourteen years ago, she was heading to Dodi Fayed's apartment off the Champs Elysees in Paris.A few weeks before the first anniversary of their deaths, I was allowed to take a film crew inside the flat.The lodgings were opulent. There were lots of beautiful ornaments. But it was gauche too. We were told nobody had been allowed to change anything there since the fatal car crash in the Pont d'Alma tunnel. It was frozen in time.... somewhere in the 1970s....

The strange case of Sally Bercow, wife of Parliamentary Speaker John. Strange, because most of those who submit to the televisual colliseum of Big Brother have shame to expunge or an expired career to revive. She had neither.Strange too, because it poses awkward questions about marriage.Mrs Bercow may have many talents: but most people know who she is because of her husband.And her husband is not just famous, he is embodies We The People - keeping the MPs we choose to represent Us - in order....

We are fat and getting fatter.So obese in fact that Britain should consider taxing sugary drinks and snacks - according to the Lancet.Using price to 'nudge' fatties away from obesity might work. Where education programmes and Jamie Oliver have failed, perhaps putting a fiver on the cost of a Mars bar might.However, the example of cigarettes is not encouraging. How many times were we told that Budget Day duties would curb our addiction to nicotine?...

Chinese primary schools sponsored by tobacco firms More than 100 primary schools in China are now sponsored by tobacco companies on the hunt for the next generation of smokers, according to antismoking campaigners. 
The Sichuan Tobacco Hope Elementary School 
 By Malcolm Moore, Shanghai and Stephen Adams 
4:15PM BST 21 Sep 2011 
The schools often bear the names of Chinese cigarette brands, such as Zhongnanhai or Liqun, over their gates and in some cases have slogans in the playground. 
"Talent comes from hard work Tobacco helps you become talented," says one slogan, in foot-high gilt letters, on the front of the Sichuan Tobacco Hope Primary School. 
The school, which was built by the local tobacco company after a deadly earthquake in 2008, also bears the green leaf logo of China Tobacco, the country's all-powerful state-controlled monopoly, on its parapet. 
China Tobacco is the world's largest manufacturer of tobacco products, with over 900 brands, and is owned by the Chinese government. China is the world's largest tobacco market and as many as 60 per cent of its men smoke. 
Regulations to prevent smoking in public places, including schools, have been widely ignored and the World Health Organisation estimates that two million Chinese will die each year of smoking-related diseases by the end of the decade accelerating the need to find more young smokers.

"It is not just primary schools, they also fund secondary schools and universities. But it is difficult to count them, because the Ministry of Education would not help us," said Wu Yiqun at the Think Tank Research Centre for Health Development. The figures were compiled by more than 60 prominent researchers in a report: Tobacco Control and China's Future. 
"We know there are definitely over 100 primary schools though because those are the ones we managed to look up by searching for schools with cigarette brands in their names." 
Anti-smoking campaigners described the sponsorship deals as sickening and shocking, and noted they broke the World Health Organisations Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which China ratified in 2005. 
Cary Adams, chief executive of the Union for International Cancer Control, said: Having just concluded a historic UN summit on non-communicable diseases where tobacco was highlighted as crucial to 
lessening the global burden of cancer, it is both shocking and disheartening to hear reports of such disregard for the health of so many young people. 
He added: Governments need to be in the business of helping their citizens, not propelling this epidemic further. 
Amanda Sandford, research manager at the charity Ash, said: Smoking among women in China is currently low compared to that of men. But tobacco industry sponsorshp of primary schools is a sickeningly 
blatent means of recruiting young girls, as well as boys, to a life of addiction to a deadly drug. 
She pointed out that about 1.2 million of Chinas 300 million smokers died every year from smoking-related diseases, a figure expected to triple by 2030. 
There are now 16 million smokers under the age of 15 in China, 6.3 per cent of the youth population, according to the Chinese government. 
Meanwhile, a survey of 12,000 schoolchildren by Peking University last year found that almost a third of boys between 13 and 15 have tried smoking and that the average age Chinese smokers have their first cigarette is 10. 
Many of the primary schools funded by tobacco companies are part of China's Hope project, a charity that has rolled out schools in the countryside for the poor. 
"The parents are actually very supportive of the tobacco companies," said Mrs Wu. "They think they are giving something back to society, but they are just using charity as a front." Sponsorship of a Hope school costs 200,000 yuan (20,000), she added. 
Tobacco companies have also built a network of libraries in the countryside, including at least 42 primary school libraries in Xinjiang and 40 in Tibet. They also widely sponsor school sports events and entertainment shows and in some provinces hold competitions for the best teacher. 
"Inside the schools, they often have branded uniforms and distribute cigarette-shaped sweets. Vendors near the school gates usually sell cigarettes one-by-one, rather than in packets," said Mrs Wu. 
Last year, the Ministry of Education banned all advertisements for tobacco on the campuses of Chinese schools, but have found it difficult to implement the regulation on Hope schools, which are administered by another arm of the Chinese government. 
Shackling the tobacco industry has proved next to impossible for the Chinese government, which relies on it for a huge slice of its tax revenues. In some tobacco growing provinces, such as Yunnan, the industry generates more than 40 per cent of the local government tax take.

Divine Religions started in French Chauvet Cave!/EINPresswire.com/Over 30,000 years ago, a spectacular Story of Creation was finger-puttied into the cave wall of Chauvet's Hillaire Chamber. 'Genesis of the World' appears to be a foundational cornerstone for subsequent Scripture. Indeed, religious symbolism dawned in southern France with this six meter mural. The star of this magical scene is a Winged Horse! A Universal Holy Being who symbolizes the spiritual bodies of both God and man. The first religious artifact (predating Noah's Ark and Ark of the Covenant): details still found throughout Traditional Lore and Holy Books. www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/chauvet/en/owpt14.htm 
*The Horse Cherub's front hoof (artfully tapered/pointed for emphasis) is shown symbolically striking a mountain- gushing forth a waterfall of Inspired Life/Being/Creation. 28,000 years later, the Bible's Book of Genesis records Adam being made from the earth's clay at basically the same time Pegasus of Greco-Roman Lore was credited with "using its front hooves to strike the ground of the earth and generate the Fountain of the Muses- Inspiring the root of all Creativity." (Origins and Consciousness, Erich Neumann) *The Creator's Steed multitasks- urinating a white cloud of (most certainly) holy, life sustaining water, while fertilizing and seeding the earth. These streams ("previously unexplained parallel lines under the horse") clearly point back to the Steed's most male parts! *This Inspired Parade of Creation continues with the Mammoth White Elephant- who symbolizes the Universal Monarch for Hindus/Buddhists. Incredibly- the Shaman drew a 'parade dress tassel' that springs forward from the high point of this Majestic Beast's front shoulders- indicating body adornment/jewelry, domestication and celebration! Very impressive. *Resembling the ancient Tarpan wild horse, this Angel of the Lord demonstrates effort and wide eyed determination- its head is lowered and wing(s) swept back. The thick mane crests and falls to the far side of the neck, allowing full view of that stylized wing. Known by many names: Magic Carpet; Tree of Life; Conductor of Souls; Emblem of Atlantis; Wheel; Throne; Unicorn; Christopher (Christ Bearer); Burak; Kalki; Odin's Steed; Paraclete; Guardian Angel- the Holy Books honor this Living Angelic Creature from Creation to the Story of Judgment Day! *A huge, snooted, earthbound pig/boar looks on facing/confronting this parade. The pig/boar has dual symbolism. This Adversary/Devil/Sloth of the Earth stands ready to tempt, but known in the Orient for luck, prosperity and fertility- it also welcomes/promotes life. Insightful! *God's Steed is the Creator's Holy Spirit in this Chauvet masterpiece. Located by design in the Hillaire Chamber- it intentionally overlooks the cave's sinkhole. The Shaman used this site's geography, contours, reliefs and spectacular abyss to 'stage' a most complete creation story. This cave's water path exit and darkness are symbolic of the River Styx and Hades/Hell. A vivid reminder of our future and most certainly used for ceremonial burial- explaining the complete absence of human bones. Wow! *The Angel of the Lord's presence at this original Story of Creation may help explain Genesis 1:26 from the Bible. "Let us make man in our own image after our likeness." Image/likeness here refers to spiritual being, not the temporary body. Angels indeed predate mankind, attending our Creation. The concepts of Angels; Trinity; The Creator's Holy Spirit and Judgment Day are also shared by the Holy Books! *The Angelic Horse/Holy Spirit is truly the Big Wheel, who at times travels in that form- do we see it here? That impressive quite round sinkhole is the ceremonial portal to and from the hidden Spiritual world. Jesus Christ went 'down' to Hades first after dying! The Angelic Horse with Its Wheel are now the first Religious Symbol followed by: the Circumpunct/Solar Cross (tie); Hindu Swastika; Tree of Life/Paisley and many Crosses. No lost symbol! *The Chauvet Grotto features a Noah's Ark variety of animals- appropriate for the Creation theme! Wooly Rhinoceros is the most numerous, but expected- as the single horn symbolizes eternal salvation by pointing the 'Way to Heaven'. Mentioned in the Bible, the legendary Unicorn was born right here, an inspired variation of God's Steed which honors The Creator. The Lone Centaur poses on a hanging rock- symbolizing ascension/enlightenment, the metaphysical unification of Soul and Spirit. Centaurs are present in all religions today. Inspired art of Divine Creation is on display at Chauvet. Enjoy! *Immense credit and thanks to the Inspired and very Holy Shaman Artist who pushed back our earliest known comprehensive narrative composition another 15,000 years! The Shaman's lucid Vision of Creation while in a psilocybin powered, entranced altered higher state of consciousness (ASC) apparently opened the Channel to Heaven's Mysteries and Universal Cognitive Truth. Clan members could now be shown the Story of Creation and answer to the age old question we all seem to ask- "Why are we here?" This is a cornerstone for subsequent Traditional Lore! Many Spiritual, Religious and Academic/Scientific (Johns Hopkins University 2006) use Magic Mushrooms to amplify their spirituality- i.e. Take the Magic Carpet Ride; Stairway to Heaven; Vision Quest; and the Ascension Dream, which Stars our heart based Guardian Angel- the Winged Horse. These hunter/gatherers prized the Fungus among us Mushrooms which were painted/recorded in other French cave art. Their incredible, edible value is reflected in Chauvet by the prominence given to their sources- Wooly Rhinoceros and Wooly Mammoth. Picture a warm, fresh cow pie giving off apparent steam on a frigid day- now envision mammoth Patties insulating/incubating the ice age mushrooms. Imagine the glee felt by the tribe members who simply harvested them, with one hand. Truffles from Snuffles! God's Steed- Key to World Peace (C) 2011 Breese/DAoust is a unique non-fiction that cites Scripture, Lore, science, many witnesses and a plethora of cherubim graphics- all confirming the existence of this fine Angelic Beast. Horsefeathers? January 3, 1994: God's Steed visited Breese's living room, who detailed a report to the Church and they Knighted him. Chauvet-Pont-dArc was discovered December 18th, 1994. This Holy Site may help dawn the predicted Age of Aquarius. keytoworldpeace@hotmail.com Sir Knight Daryl Breese

Participating companies will receive a summary of findings including best practice considerations and a complete benchmarking appendix comparing participants' results to benchmark groups for easy review. Participants are also invited to attend a webinar presentation of key findings. The cost to participate in the survey is $850.

TiVo(R) Integrates With Facebook(R) Platform to Define the Future of Social TV TiVo iPad and iPhone Apps to Add Deeper Facebook Integration Layering Friends' Recommendations and Real-Time Viewing Activity Over TiVo's Smart Search, Browse and Suggestion Features 
TiVo Inc. (NASDAQ: TIVO), the creator of and leader in advanced television services including digital video recorders (DVRs), announced in conjunction with f8, Facebook's developer conference, that it will update its popular iPhone and iPad apps to include additional integration with Facebook to increase Social TV functionality. Facebook's newly announced Like and Watch integrations with the enhanced Facebook APIs which will allow people who use the TiVo service to further connect with family, friends, and subscribers around the entertainment they love to offer an added layer of recommendations further enabling TiVo lovers to enjoy brilliant TV from the world's only smart DVR. The improved Facebook integration creates a social guide for people to expand their typical entertainment choices by discovering new programs through the recommendations of their Facebook friends. TiVo users will be able to discover programs their Facebook friends endorse with the Like feature, or view what shows their friends are currently enjoying with the Watch feature and immediately schedule a recording or watch live based on those recommendations. And because the TiVo iPad and iPhone apps are linked to the TiVo DVR, TiVo users can feature the program they're watching to their friends and subscribers on Facebook with a flick of their finger. "When we launched the TiVo apps for iPhone and iPad earlier this year, we did so with the goal of expanding the ways TiVo lovers can interact with people, the web, and the entertainment they're viewing while they watch TV. With this improved Facebook integration, TiVo users can discover things to watch from the new social guide, and can feature their entertainment experiences and choices with their friends," said Jim Denney, Vice President and General Manager of product marketing for TiVo Inc. "Through full integration with the set-top box, TiVo is defining the future of Social TV by offering a new way for people to connect and interact on the second screen in a way that is fully integrated with their actual TV watching experience." The TiVo App retains its unique and easy-to-use interface and lets people peruse TiVo's hallmark search, browse and recommendation functions, without disrupting what they are watching on the big screen. As people connect and interact with the Social TV features on the TiVo app, they will have more robust access to suggested programming provided by their networks on Facebook. The improved integrations will launch on the TiVo app later this year. The TiVo App is available for free from the App Store on iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, or at www.itunes.com/appstore.

Ticketfly Launches Facebook Integration to Make Attending Live Music Events More Social 
Core News Facts: 
Today at f8, Facebook's developer conference, Ticketfly announced a new Facebook integration that allows ticket buyers to share the artists they are excited to see at upcoming music events with their friends. 
Beyond letting your friends know what you like, Ticketfly now helps fans discover what events their friends are actually going to see. 
How it works: following a ticket purchase, ticket buyers see an overlay or "light box" on their purchase confirmation page which allows them to share with their friends in three important ways. In one click, ticket buyers can: (1) create a personalized News Feed story and "like" artists, (2) RSVP to the event, and (3) invite friends to purchase tickets to the same event. 
Facebook has always made it easy to discover great things through your friends; now Ticketfly, with this new Facebook integration, makes it even easier to discover more music artists and events with your friends. 
As one of the developers included in the f8 announcements, Ticketfly is leading the way in making the live music and ticketing industries more social. 
"Music promoters are always excited when we deliver a new Facebook feature. This latest integration is particularly powerful because it sits directly inside the ticket purchase process and gives fans an easy way to connect around live music and discover new artists," said Dan Teree, President & COO of Ticketfly. "Tapping the Facebook social graph improves the experience for ticket buyers, our clients and artists and is core to Ticketfly's mission of making it easy for friends to see amazing music together." Through Facebook Platform, people can share the experience of seeing musical artists with their friends, making their online experience more personal and relevant. Please visit: www.ticketfly.com/blog to learn more about Ticketfly's integration with Facebook. About Ticketfly Ticketfly is the leading independent social ticketing company in the U.S. Ticketfly offers live entertainment venues and promoters fully-integrated ticketing, social marketing, website management, email marketing and mobile tools, saving them time and money. Ticketfly was created by the team that first brought event ticketing to the Web. Recently, Fast Company named Ticketfly one of the Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in Music and Billboard called Ticketfly one of the Five Hot Digital Music Companies to Watch.

 Introduction ::China 
 Background: 
For centuries China stood as a leading civilization, outpacing the rest of the world in the arts and sciences, but in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil unrest, major famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight. China since the early 1990s has increased its global outreach and participation in international organizations.

 Economy ::China 
 Economy - overview: 
Since the late 1970s China has moved from a closed, centrally planned system to a more market-oriented one that plays a major global role - in 2010 China became the world's largest exporter. Reforms began with the phasing out of collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state enterprises, creation of a diversified banking system, development of stock markets, rapid growth of the private sector, and opening to foreign trade and investment. China has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion. In recent years, China has renewed its support for state-owned enterprises in sectors it considers important to "economic security," explicitly looking to foster globally competitive national champions. After keeping its currency tightly linked to the US dollar for years, in July 2005 China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies. From mid 2005 to late 2008 cumulative appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar was more than 20%, but the exchange rate remained virtually pegged to the dollar from the onset of the global financial crisis until June 2010, when Beijing allowed resumption of a gradual appreciation. The restructuring of the economy and resulting efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in GDP since 1978. Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2010 stood as the second-largest economy in the world after the US, having surpassed Japan in 2001. The dollar values of China's agricultural and industrial output each exceed those of the US; China is second to the US in the value of services it produces. Still, per capita income is below the world average. The Chinese government faces numerous economic challenges, including: (a) reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low domestic demand; (b) sustaining adequate job growth for tens of millions of migrants and new entrants to the work force; (c) reducing corruption and other economic crimes; and (d) containing environmental damage and social strife related to the economy's rapid transformation. Economic development has progressed further in coastal provinces than in the interior, and approximately 200 million rural laborers and their dependents have relocated to urban areas to find work. One consequence of the "one child" policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table, especially in the north - is another long-term problem. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic development. The Chinese government is seeking to add energy production capacity from sources other than coal and oil, focusing on nuclear and alternative energy development. In 2009, the global economic downturn reduced foreign demand for Chinese exports for the first time in many years, but China rebounded quickly, outperforming all other major economies in 2010 with GDP growth around 10%. The economy appears set to remain on a strong growth trajectory in 2011, lending credibility to the stimulus policies the regime rolled out during the global financial crisis. The government vows, in the 12th Five-Year Plan adopted in March 2011, to continue reforming the economy and emphasizes the need to increase domestic consumption in order to make the economy less dependent on exports for GDP growth in the future. However, China likely will make only marginal progress toward these rebalancing goals in 2011. Two economic problems China currently faces are inflation - which, late in 2010, surpassed the government's target of 3% - and local government debt, which swelled as a result of stimulus policies, and is largely off-the-books and potentially low-quality.

Torrential rains batter parts of China, floods spread 
Thu, Jun 16 2011 By Chris Buckley BEIJING (Reuters) - Pelting rain in parts of central and southern China has forced hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and prompted the government to demand safety checks on vulnerable dams, news reports said on Thursday. The torrential rains have ended a drought in many areas, but now threaten the Yangtze River basin and nearby provinces with floods and mudslides that have killed at least 105 people. In Jiangxi province in east China, troops helped 122,400 residents move from vulnerable low-lying areas, said the China News Service. In Hubei province in the center, downpours two days ago triggered a landslide that left six people missing and blocked the Pingdu River, forcing 2,000 residents to flee in case a wall of water burst through the mud and debris. "Many small dams face major hazards," said China's Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters (fxkh.mwr.gov.cn), adding that "all areas must pay high attention to the safety of dams and hydro stations." In Zhejiang, an eastern province with many manufacturers, officials moved 120,000 residents as surging flood waters cut hundreds of roads and drove the Qiantang River to its highest flood peak since 1955, Xinhua news agency reported late on Thursday. Forecasters warned that in the coming days rains could bring fresh dangers, including in the southwest. "Tonight the rains will start from Sichuan province and Chongqing and move east," said meteorologist Li Xiaoquan, according to China's weather news website (www.weather.com.cn). The national forecaster also said heavy showers could hit Guangdong, the export-driven province next to Hong Kong. Floods and mudslides caused by the rain have killed at least 105 people and 65 are missing, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday. No official tally of the total number of deaths has been issued since then. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; editing by Tim Pearce)

BEIJING -- More than 5 million people have been displaced or otherwise affected by flooding in eastern China that is also pushing up food prices, state media reported Sunday. Torrential rains have left huge areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces under water, with more than 1 million acres (432,200 hectares) of farmland inundated, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Almost 1,000 businesses have been forced to suspend operations and 5.7 million people have had their lives disrupted, Xinhua said in a brief report. More than 7,000 homes collapsed or were otherwise damaged and direct financial damage was estimated at almost 6 billion yuan ($930 million). The downpour triggered a mudslide that buried houses and killed two people in Zhejiang's Changshan county, while two more were killed and two left missing by flooding in Hubei, Xinhua said. Flooding in eastern and southern China this month has left more than 170 people dead or missing. Roads and railways have been blocked, but aid supplies are arriving and the country's weather bureau says skies are expected to clear up Monday. Farmers quoted by Xinhua said the flooding was the worst in 20 years, reducing vegetable output by 20 percent and also causing shortages of fruits and grains. Prices for green vegetables were up 40 percent, Xinhua said, adding to an inflation rate of 5.5 percent, a three-year high. The increase in the consumer price index reported last week was in line with expectations but higher than April's 5.3 percent and March's 5.4 percent. The National Statistics Bureau said the main factor was an 11.7 percent jump in food prices. Higher food prices blamed on flooding were also reported in the eastern provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, Xinhua said.

 Just over a week ago there were many China bashers attacking the Three Gorges Dam as the cause for the 50 year drought that was affecting the same provinces as the flood region now. I shall love to hear from the same people how the 3GD is the cause of the floods now. 
This much should be evident. During the drought the 3GD had impounded water that was used to alleviate the drought. Without the dam there would not be any available water at all. As another commentator said (5 millions flooded out) everything in China is large numbers. That impounded water still barely made an impression on the parched lands as it affected several tens of thousands of square miles. 
Now we have this 50 year flood. Again without the 3GD to hold back the up river waters, had the rainstorms reached the upper reaches of the Yangtze, the floods downriver would have been even more devastating and affect an even bigger area. No the rains haven't reached there yet. But at least there is the very significant comfort that should it rain excessively there the runoff won't reach downriver unrestricted to add to the downriver miseries. Any overabundance of water can be be held back by the 3GD for a controlled release. Nothing much can be done to control the current downriver floods. With the 3GD it is assured that it won't get any worse.

 NATURAL DISASTERS? 
Electric cars, light bulbs and solar panels won't change anything as weather becomes extreme. It will worsen as China and India's 2,500,000,000 people move up the success ladder and demand more energy. 
Check all earth sciences and you will discover everything in the process of collapse due to over population of the planet including starvation, which has been going on for years, will pick up momentum. 
Dufar in the Sudan looks on the surface to be ethnic cleansing. Next time you look, look not at the starving people but the desert they live in that won't support the winners of this war. 
The Sahara is moving south at 20 miles a year. Soon they will all starve while in China, 37% of the ground water is not fit for human consumption and 34% of that is not fit for irrigation. 
Because people continue reproducing at a breakneck pace, They refuse to recognize that this planet cant sustain 7,300,000,000 devouring everything like a plague of locus in a wheat field. 
Extreme weather at this point is beyond human reach to repair it. Its picking up momentum as anything does when going down hill. We don't have 100's of years left in spite of what many people want to believe. 
The planet will continue to heat up for the next several thousand years since it is now running on automatic and regardless of what you hear not much can be done about it.

 Hope the people are found and returned to normal soon. If the region is a natural flood zone or new farming district, did the dams impact natural flow of water? Is the draining system updated to all connect and filter somewhere needed? To sump pump it out and put where lacking water would make sense,pooled and filtered. Could the crops be pulled from the water and transplanted to other regions or rooftops to grow? May the wasted infrared glasses around here be put to better use with the military on after storm units for trouble as this . Move the displaced into hotels nearby. Dievs to you. ~ Maija from Detroit

 My prayers go out for the people who are mostly poor in the agricultural areas. It will be interesting to see if China asks for help from its allies--not us---or if we can balance our trade deficit with China by sending them our produce at higher prices too, esp since they play monopoly with their yen to our dollar. I would like to see the Arabs, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and Mexico and the other countries that China is cozying up with me offer assistance.

 So if we use your logic, then why is gasoline so cheap in Saudi Arabia than it is in the US? We import crude so according to your logic, gasoline should be higher in Saudi Arabia.

Rainstorms Drench Hunan 
Adjust font size: 
More rain has hit central China's Hunan Province disrupting the lives of at least onemillion residents. Torrential rains in the province have driven up river-water levels. In Lishui city, levels rose more than two meters in one day. And major streets are still flooded in Xinhua County, where rain-damage has cut off power supplies and access to clean drinking water. Heavy downpours have also caused landslides destroying more than one thousand five hundred homes. Meanwhile, residents have been evacuated from Loudi City and almost fifty smaller towns. The weekend's storms have been the heaviest to hit Hunan since the start of the annual rainy season. (CCTV.com July 10, 2006)
