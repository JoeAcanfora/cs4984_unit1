Chinese primary schools sponsored by tobacco firms 
More than 100 primary schools in China are now sponsored by tobacco companies on the hunt for the next generation of smokers, according to antismoking campaigners.

The schools often bear the names of Chinese 
  cigarette brands, such as Zhongnanhai or Liqun, over their gates and in some 
  cases have slogans in the playground.


"Talent comes from hard work – Tobacco helps you become talented," 
  says one slogan, in foot-high gilt letters, on the front of the Sichuan 
  Tobacco Hope Primary School.


The school, which was built by the local tobacco company after a deadly 
  earthquake in 2008, also bears the green leaf logo of China Tobacco, the 
  country's all-powerful state-controlled monopoly, on its parapet.


China Tobacco is the world's largest manufacturer of tobacco products, with 
  over 900 brands, and is owned by the Chinese government. China is the 
  world's largest tobacco market and as many as 60 per cent of its men smoke.


Regulations to prevent smoking in public places, including schools, have been 
  widely ignored and the World Health Organisation estimates that two million 
  Chinese will die each year of smoking-related diseases by the end of the 
  decade – accelerating the need to find more young smokers.

"It is not just primary schools, they also fund secondary schools and 
  universities. But it is difficult to count them, because the Ministry of 
  Education would not help us," said Wu Yiqun at the Think Tank Research 
  Centre for Health Development. The figures were compiled by more than 60 
  prominent researchers in a report: Tobacco Control and China's Future.


"We know there are definitely over 100 primary schools though because 
  those are the ones we managed to look up by searching for schools with 
  cigarette brands in their names." 


Anti-smoking campaigners described the sponsorship deals as “sickening” and 
  “shocking”, and noted they broke the World Health Organisation’s Framework 
  Convention on Tobacco Control, which China ratified in 2005.


Cary Adams, chief executive of the Union for International Cancer Control, 
  said: “Having just concluded a historic UN summit on non-communicable 
  diseases where tobacco was highlighted as crucial to


lessening the global burden of cancer, it is both shocking and disheartening 
  to hear reports of such disregard for the health of so many young people.”


He added: “Governments need to be in the business of helping their citizens, 
  not propelling this epidemic further.”


Amanda Sandford, research manager at the charity Ash, said: “Smoking among 
  women in China is currently low compared to that of men. But tobacco 
  industry sponsorshp of primary schools is a sickeningly


blatent means of recruiting young girls, as well as boys, to a life of 
  addiction to a deadly drug.”


She pointed out that about 1.2 million of China’s 300 million smokers died 
  every year from smoking-related diseases, a figure expected to triple by 
  2030.


There are now 16 million smokers under the age of 15 in China, 6.3 per cent of 
  the youth population, according to the Chinese government.


Meanwhile, a survey of 12,000 schoolchildren by Peking University last year 
  found that almost a third of boys between 13 and 15 have tried smoking and 
  that the average age Chinese smokers have their first cigarette is 10.


Many of the primary schools funded by tobacco companies are part of China's 
  Hope project, a charity that has rolled out schools in the countryside for 
  the poor.


"The parents are actually very supportive of the tobacco companies," 
  said Mrs Wu. "They think they are giving something back to society, but 
  they are just using charity as a front." Sponsorship of a Hope school 
  costs 200,000 yuan (£20,000), she added.


Tobacco companies have also built a network of libraries in the countryside, 
  including at least 42 primary school libraries in Xinjiang and 40 in Tibet. 
  They also widely sponsor school sports events and entertainment shows and in 
  some provinces hold competitions for the best teacher.


"Inside the schools, they often have branded uniforms and distribute 
  cigarette-shaped sweets. Vendors near the school gates usually sell 
  cigarettes one-by-one, rather than in packets," said Mrs Wu.


Last year, the Ministry of Education banned all advertisements for tobacco on 
  the campuses of Chinese schools, but have found it difficult to implement 
  the regulation on Hope schools, which are administered by another arm of the 
  Chinese government.


Shackling the tobacco industry has proved next to impossible for the Chinese 
  government, which relies on it for a huge slice of its tax revenues. In some 
  tobacco growing provinces, such as Yunnan, the industry generates more than 
  40 per cent of the local government tax take.
