Turning Warmer

I'm back from my holiday and pleased to see that there will be some fine and warm weather over the weekend.Many places will stay dry, with sunny spells, but Ireland and western Britain will be cloudier and breezier, with patchy rain or the risk of showers. More persistent rain will move in later on Sunday, when it will turn very windy as well.It should feel warmer too, particularly across central and eastern England. Temperatures there will range from 20 to 23 Celsius (68 to 73F)....

Storms and gale force winds are expected to hit the north west of the U.K in less than 12 hours from the remnants of hurricane Katia. Rain will be spreading north east tonight, followed by strong winds and local gales. The forecast chart of the North Atlantic below shows that by Monday lunchtime the deep area of low pressure will also bring severe gales from north Wales northwards. Gusts of wind will probably reach 75mph in western parts of Scotland including the Argyll islands,...

The weather looks to become very wild by the end of the weekend, but I hope to be enjoying the hot sunshine on holiday in the eastern Mediterranean!This weekend, the wind will strengthen across Britain and Ireland, but it's the weather late on Sunday and into Monday that we need to keep a close eye on. A deep area of low pressure is expected to move in, which will actually be the remnants of Hurricane Katia.There will be very strong winds across all parts on Monday,...

The 12th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical storm Lee is currently in the Gulf of Mexico and looks to give torrential rainfall over the next few days. There are storm warnings already from Mississippi to Texas, including New Orleans and also flash flood warnings along the Alabama coast into Florida. There could be around 10 to 15 inches of rain over southern parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama through Sunday, some spots could get up to 20 inches....

Summer's End, Was It Ever Here?

Over the next few days, an area of high pressure will continue to give settled conditions and that means a largely dry start to September. Yes I said September! I can't believe we are heading into autumn (meteorologically speaking). Have we had a summer?! It will be interesting to see where this summer stands historically, because it's been rather cool and fairly wet. Eastern Scotland in particular has had a lot of rain.There will be a good deal of dry weather through the middle of the week,...

Keep An Eye On Irene

Here are some useful sites to keep track on hurricane Irene.You may be wowed by the radar loop and the latest gusts but this is a big storm system and it could well have devastating effects.Strong winds, torrential rain, storm surge and high waves are the concerns. Expect widespread flooding with power outages and wind damage.Look at the National Hurricane Centre (NHC) for the latest radar. You should be able to pick out the eye. The latest winds and gusts are shown clearly here....

There will be some wet and unseasonably windy conditions for the north and east of Scotland this Bank Holiday Weekend; across the Atlantic, eastern areas of the USA are preparing for the worst.  Hurricane Irene, now a major hurricane at category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale currently lies to the east of the Bahamian capital Nassau, with winds reaching 115mph (185kph). The northern Caribbean islands have already seen devastating floods and landslides,...

It's a long way off yet but... after a showery and breezy few days the weather looks like settling down.The remainder of this week is likely to be unsettled, breezy and showery. It'll feel rather more autumnal for a time too.However, there are signs that over this coming August Bank Holiday weekend high pressure could return bringing some warmer, sunnier and more settled days especially through Sunday and Monday....

The fifth day of the Fourth Test at the Oval is set fair.Expect a warm and sunny start at 11am with the sunshine lasting into the afternoon. It'll feel warm with the temperature reaching 23 Celsius, 73 Fahrenheit.There'll be changes from mid-afternoon onwards, however, with cloud invading the sky from the south and bringing the chance of some evening rain. At this stage it looks as though there'll be rain from around 6pm onwards.You can see the latest radar rainfall here....

Yesterday was fine for many places, but much of Scotland, Ireland, northern England and north Wales will stay cloudy today, with further spells of rain. The heaviest downpours will be over western hills, with a risk of local flooding for central and southern Scotland, northwest England and northwest Wales. It will feel cool in the rain, even quite chilly for parts of Scotland, Wick is currently only 10 Celsius (50F). There will also be a strong, gusty wind across Ireland and central Britain,...
