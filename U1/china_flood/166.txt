Flood of Yellow River Tributary Affects 1.6 Million People




 





The flood of the Yellow River's biggest tributary, Weihe, already affected 1.6 million local residents and caused direct economic losses estimated at 490 million yuan (US$60.49 million) in Shaanxi Province, northwest China, sources said Tuesday. 

Continued heavy rains over the past week caused the biggest flood in ten years along the Weihe River, with crest passing Weinan City on mid-Tuesday measured at 4,820 cubic meters per second. 

The flood inundated an area of 180,000 hectares, washed down 12,000 houses and endangered another 25,449 in 11 counties and districts of Weinan City, which suffered most, city officials said. 

Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-Premier Hui Liangyu have urged great efforts to guarantee the life and property safety of the people. Both provincial Party chief Li Jianguo and Governor Chen Deming inspected the flood relief and prevention works along the Weihe River on Monday. 

So far, 315,000 people have been evacuated to safe places, and 30,000 others have been mobilized to ensure the safety of embankments.
