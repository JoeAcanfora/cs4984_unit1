It may be defined as a supercontinent, consisting of Africa and Eurasia (further divided into Asia and Europe). The constituent landmasses encompass 84,980,532 square kilometers and have a population of approximately 5.7 billion people, or roughly 85% of the world population. It is also known as the Old World, as opposed to the Americas, which are known as the New World.The mainland of Afro-Eurasia has been referred to as the World Island, a term coined by Sir Halford John Mackinder in The Geographical Pivot of History. The term excludes non-mainland islands and archipelagos.GeologyIn geological terms, Afro-Eurasia is expected to become a supercontinent when Africa collides with Europe. This is estimated to happen over 600,000 years from now, when the southern tip of Spain reaches Africa. When this happens, the Mediterranean Sea will be isolated from the Atlantic Ocean. Africa is expected to collide with Europe completely over 50 million years from now, closing the Mediterranean and creating new, future mountain ranges.SourceDescription above from the Wikipedia article Afro-Eurasia, licensed under CC-BY-SA full list of contributors here.
