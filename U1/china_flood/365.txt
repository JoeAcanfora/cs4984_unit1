Is Cameron Turning Into Blair? 


September 22, 2011 7:53 PM
			 - Written by
			 
Jon Craig





David Cameron's speech to the United Nations, about using force against tyrants, could have been made by Tony Blair.In fact, comparisons are already being drawn between Cameron's New York speech in 2011 and Tony Blair's Chicago speech in 1999, when he made the case for military action in Kosovo.Listen to what Cameron says about saving lives and preventing slaughter in Libya and the message is essentially the same as Blair's about Kosovo.Cameron demanded sanctions against Syria,...

Remember the Blair government's slogan "Schools and Hospitals First" ?We now enjoy shiny new buildings all over the country, which replaced some of the old, Victorian hospitals, schools with leaking roofs and so on, that were clearly not fit for purpose - but they have come at a cost.The only way the government could afford to do it was to enter into Privaye Finance Iniative deals: Private companies would construct the buildings, the government would pay for them over a period of, typically,...

Nick Clegg's Speech: A Quiet Success 


September 21, 2011 4:08 PM
			 - Written by
			 
Sophy Ridge


When Nick Clegg started his speech, his tone was sombre and serious - almost a monotone.It's been "painful", he said. "None of us predicted just how tough it would be.""We've lost support, we've lost councillors, and we lost a referendum" - as if they needed reminding.The atmosphere in the room was not jubilant by any means. There were moments of cheers and claps - but a lot of empty silence to match the empty seats.All this sounds pretty gloomy.But the truth is,...

What Would Attlee Say?

Jon Craig





So Ed Miliband's plan to change the way Labour elects its leader is "not a done deal", senior party officials have insisted to me.You can say that again.Senior trade union leaders - including some of Labour's biggest financial backers - are not at all happy."Wait for the conference on Sunday!" the general secretary of one major trade union told me, menacingly.Ed wants to sign up "tens of thousands" of "registered supporters", nominated by Labour Party members,...

Don't Mention The Strikes!

Britain is just months away from what could be the most disruptive national strike action in years.Unions are calling for national campaigns of 'civil disobedience' to protest against cuts to pensions and public services.This so-called 'autumn of discontent' is almost upon us, but going by the speeches at the Lib Dem conference, you'd never know it.Some of the party's most prominent ministers are at heart of the controversial coalition economic policies that are driving union anger....

Huhne Sends Warning Shot

			 - Written by
			 
Sophy Ridge





I've been passed a leaked copy of the Energy Secretary Chris Huhne's speech to party conference - and it will make uncomfortable reading for some Conservatives.There's lots of details about energy prices and Ofgem - but I'm more interested in the final climax where Mr Huhne sends a clear warning shot to right wing MPs.It's the most outspoken swipe at the Tory right by a minister so far at conference.After discussing US politics,...

Kazoo-gate: An Unlikely Terror Threat 


September 19, 2011 5:10 PM
			 - Written by
			 
Tom Rayner





A BBC kazoo, blown by Lib Dem luminaries like Sarah Teather, last night became the subject of a ham-fisted police terror investigation.While officers elsewhere in Birmingham were preparing to make seven arrests as part of a large anti-terror operation, some of their colleagues near the conference centre were pursuing a rather unlikely target.A BBC radio producer had been merrily drinking away at a fringe event hosted by the Policy Exchange at the Hyatt Regency....
