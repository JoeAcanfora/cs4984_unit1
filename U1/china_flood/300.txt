Notice
        —
        For any reuse or distribution, you must make clear to others the license terms of this work. The best way to do this is with a link to this web page.
      



          A new version of this license is available. You should use it for new works, and you may want to relicense existing works under it. No works are automatically put under the new license, however.
        



        What does "conditions can be waived" mean?
      


          CC licenses anticipate that a licensor may want to
		waive compliance with a specific condition, such as
		attribution.

        What does "Public Domain" mean?

        What does "Fair use" mean?
      


          All jurisdictions
              allow some limited uses of copyrighted material without
              permission.  CC licenses do not affect the rights of
              users under those copyright limitations and exceptions,
              such as fair use and fair dealing where applicable.

        What are "Moral Rights"?
      


          In addition to the right of licensors to request removal of their name from the work when used in a derivative or collective they don't like, copyright laws in most jurisdictions around the world (with the notable exception of the US except in very limited circumstances) grant creators "moral rights" which may provide some redress if a derivative work represents a "derogatory treatment" of the licensor's work.

        What are "Publicity Rights"?
      


          Publicity
              rights allow individuals to control how their voice,
              image or likeness is used for commercial purposes in
              public.  If a CC-licensed work includes the voice or
              image of anyone other than the licensor, a user of the
              work may need to get permission from those individuals
              before using the work for commercial purposes.
