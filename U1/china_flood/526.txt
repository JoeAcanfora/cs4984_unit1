The Wal-Mart National Mall? Anything's Possible As We Turn Ourselves Into USA. Inc. (Joe Rothstein's Commentary)
September 15, 2011
By Joe Rothstein
Editor, EINNEWS.com

I've been thinking a lot lately about the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.

Maybe it's just because a new football season has kicked off.

Or maybe it's because the University of Maryland football team played its first game wearing outlandish uniforms supplied by Under Armour.  Other college teams, please excuse the pun, are following suit with other vendors.

Or maybe it's because of my recent visit to Chicago where Millennium Park has become something of a corporate billboard: AT&T Plaza, Chase Promenade, BP Bridge. There's talk of selling the naming rights for the park itself.

Call me old-fashioned, but I grew up in an era when the Sugar Bowl was quaintly known as the "Sugar Bowl," not the AllState Sugar Bowl.  And when I went to Brooklyn, New York, I didn't emerge from the Barclay Bank subway station.  

As public money dries up, private money is buying public spaces.  Governments are broke.  But  corporations are sitting on bundles of cash.  Latest estimates are that major corporations have about $1.5 t-r-i-l-l-i-o-n of uncommitted capital.  What better indicator can there be of the imbalance generated over the last few decades between private wealth and public scarcity?

Corporate profits set records in 2010 as the federal government, states and cities gave pink slips to teachers, police, fire fighters and others and closed parks and libraries.  

General Electric, which has become the poster child for dodging taxes, just repaid $3 billion it took from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway during the dark days of 2008.  That's a huge turnaround in 3 years.  $3 billion plus a handsome profit for Buffett's company, and GE still is rolling in cash.

Goldman Sachs paid out $15 billion in bonuses to its executives and employees in 2010.  Then it repaid Buffett $5 billion, plus interest, for money he loaned the company during the depth of the financial crisis.   

Neither GE nor Goldman is representative of U.S. business.  They are in a class by themselves. The too-big-to-fail class.  But once you leave that exalted tier you find plenty of U.S. companies doing exceptionally well.  

Latest numbers from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that in 2010 corporate profits  were the highest ever recorded, even higher than during World War II when companies worked around the clock to fill wartime needs.  Initial profit reports for 2011 look even stronger. 

How's this possible in the trough of hard financial times? Cheap foreign labor. Pressure on U.S. workers to work for less. "Productivity" gains from employees' working harder and longer with fewer benefits.  That's most of it.

While big corporations are thriving, small business, with fewer employees to lay off and less access to easy cash from tight-fisted banks, is in a black hole. The latest figures indicate  small businesses' share of national income in 2009 fell to a 17-year low and pretty much remained there through 2010.

As for employees, 2010 was the first year on record that wages and salaries represented less than half the total national income.  

With declining tax revenue because of the continuing recession, and the stubborn refusal of Republicans to ask the wealthiest individuals and corporations to pay a dime more than they currently are paying, public entities are turning anywhere they can to patch together budgets.

Gaming is a popular out.  With looser gambling laws, governments are saying let people tax themselves.  Then there are tuition increases, fees for licenses and documents, parking----everything that can be a tax disguised under an assumed name and levied on individuals.

It's only a small step from there to selling public places and events.  Denver's about to sign a deal with the Sports Authority to rename the city's football stadium. $150 million over 25 years.  

Boulder, Colorado is looking for a corporate sponsor for its popular Scott Carpenter Park, named in honor of the pioneer astronaut. The Mercury space capsule was so yesterday. Carpenter's achievements may remain in the history books, but an earlier generation's decision to honor his name with a public place is disposable. 

It's probably only a matter of time until the airfield once known as Washington National, and currently known as Reagan-National, becomes Reagan-GE Airport. GE employed Reagan as its spokesperson before the former President entered politics. The names sort of go together. 

And why would you keep "National," which means nothing, and pays nothing, when you can have GE?  If Denver's stadium is worth $150 million, Reagan-GE Airport should be worth, what, maybe a billion or more? 

As we continue the drift from "We, The People," to "USA, Inc.," where the new monuments are wealth and profit, is it so bizarre to think we will soon have the "Capital One Capitol Building," or our national heroes memorialized on the "Wal-Mart National Mall?"

Improbable? Whoever would have thought one of the most popular sporting events in the U.S. would be named after a corn chip?
