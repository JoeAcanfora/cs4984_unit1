CDC Urges Americans: Get Your Flu Shot

                With plenty of influenza vaccine available, U.S. health officials urged Americans to get a flu shot.
                
                Last year, some 130.9 million Americans -- about 43 percent of the population -- got a shot, which represents an increase over past years. The greatest increase was among children 6 months to 17 years old. But, more adults are getting vaccinated, too, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
