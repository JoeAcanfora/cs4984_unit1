The Graph API presents a simple, consistent view of the Facebook social graph, uniformly representing objects in the graph (e.g., people, photos, events, and pages) and the connections between them (e.g., friend relationships, shared content, and photo tags).
Every object in the social graph has a unique ID. You can access the properties of an object by requesting https://graph.facebook.com/ID. For example, the official page for the Facebook Platform has id 19292868552, so you can fetch the object at https://graph.facebook.com/19292868552:
{
   "name": "Facebook Platform",
   "type": "page",
   "website": "http://developers.facebook.com",
   "username": "platform",
   "founded": "May 2007",
   "company_overview": "Facebook Platform enables anyone to build...",
   "mission": "To make the web more open and social.",
   "products": "Facebook Application Programming Interface (API)...",
   "likes": 449921,
   "id": 19292868552,
   "category": "Technology"
}

Alternatively, people and pages with usernames can be accessed using their username as an ID. Since "platform" is the username for the page above, https://graph.facebook.com/platform will return what you expect. All responses are JSON objects.
All objects in Facebook can be accessed in the same way:

Users: https://graph.facebook.com/btaylor (Bret Taylor)
Pages: https://graph.facebook.com/cocacola (Coca-Cola page)
Events: https://graph.facebook.com/251906384206 (Facebook Developer Garage Austin)
Groups: https://graph.facebook.com/195466193802264 (Facebook Developers group)
Applications: https://graph.facebook.com/2439131959 (the Graffiti app)
Status messages: https://graph.facebook.com/367501354973 (A status message from Bret)
Photos: https://graph.facebook.com/98423808305 (A photo from the Coca-Cola page)
Photo albums: https://graph.facebook.com/99394368305 (Coca-Cola's wall photos)
Profile pictures: http://graph.facebook.com/0/picture (your profile picture)
Videos: https://graph.facebook.com/817129783203 (A Facebook tech talk on Graph API)

Checkins: https://graph.facebook.com/414866888308 (Check-in at a pizzeria)

All of the objects in the Facebook social graph are connected to each other via relationships. Bret Taylor is a fan of the Coca-Cola page, and Bret Taylor and Arjun Banker are friends. We call those relationships connections in our API. You can examine the connections between objects using the URL structure https://graph.facebook.com/ID/CONNECTION_TYPE. The connections supported for people and pages include:

Friends: https://graph.facebook.com/me/friends?access_token=...
News feed: https://graph.facebook.com/me/home?access_token=...
Profile feed (Wall): https://graph.facebook.com/me/feed?access_token=...
Likes: https://graph.facebook.com/me/likes?access_token=...
Movies: https://graph.facebook.com/me/movies?access_token=...
Music: https://graph.facebook.com/me/music?access_token=...
Books: https://graph.facebook.com/me/books?access_token=...
Notes: https://graph.facebook.com/me/notes?access_token=...
Permissions: https://graph.facebook.com/me/permissions?access_token=...
Photo Tags: https://graph.facebook.com/me/photos?access_token=...
Photo Albums: https://graph.facebook.com/me/albums?access_token=...
Video Tags: https://graph.facebook.com/me/videos?access_token=...
Video Uploads: https://graph.facebook.com/me/videos/uploaded?access_token=...
Events: https://graph.facebook.com/me/events?access_token=...
Groups: https://graph.facebook.com/me/groups?access_token=...
Checkins: https://graph.facebook.com/me/checkins?access_token=...

We support different connection types for different objects. For example, you can get the list of all the people attending the Facebook Developer Garage at SXSW (ID #331218348435) by fetching https://graph.facebook.com/331218348435/attending?access_token=....
All of the different types of objects and connections we support are included in the Graph API reference documentation. The easiest way to get started is to check out the Graph API Explorer.
Authorization
The Graph API as such allows you to easily access all public information about an object. For example, https://graph.facebook.com/btaylor (Bret Taylor) 
returns all the public information about Bret. For example a user's first name, last name and profile picture are publicly available.
To get additional information about a user, you must first get their permission. At a high level, you need to get an access token for the Facebook user. After you obtain the access token for the user, you can perform authorized requests on behalf of that user by including the access token in your Graph API requests:
https://graph.facebook.com/220439?access_token=...

For example https://graph.facebook.com/btaylor?access_token=... (Bret Taylor) 
returns additional information about Bret Taylor.
The Graph API uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. Please read the authentication guide which provides details of Facebook's OAuth 2.0 implementation, how to request permissions from a user and obtain an access token.
Getting an access token for a user with no extended permissions allows you to access the information that the user has made available to everyone on Facebook. If you need specific information about a user, like their email address or work history, you must ask for the specific extended permissions.  The reference documentation for each Graph API object contains details about the permissions you need to access each connection and property on that object.
Page Login
You can impersonate pages administrated by your users by requesting the manage_pages permission.
Once a user has granted your application the "manage_pages" permission,
the "accounts" connection will yield an access_token property for every page administrated by the current user. These access_tokens can be used to make calls on behalf of a page. The permissions granted by a user to your application will now also be applicable to their pages.
NOTE: After September 22, 2011, manage_pages permission will be required for all access to a user's pages via the /me/accounts connection, i.e. for both reading the user's pages and also retrieving access_tokens for those pages.
App Login
To make administrative calls that do not require an active user (for example, retrieving analytics data or test users) you need to obtain an access token for your app. Read more about how to get an app access token here.

Reading
The Graph API allows you to read properties and connections of the Facebook social graph. You can use the API to read specific fields, get pictures of any object, introspect an object for metadata and get real-time updates on any changes.
Selection
By default, most object properties are returned when you make a query.  You can choose the fields (or connections) you want returned with the "fields" query parameter.  For example, this URL will only return the id, name, and picture of Ben: https://graph.facebook.com/bgolub?fields=id,name,picture
You can also request multiple objects in a single query using the "ids" query parameter.  For example, the URL https://graph.facebook.com?ids=arjun,vernal returns both profiles in the same response.
The "ids" query parameter also accepts URLs. This is useful for finding IDs of URLs in the Open Graph. For example: https://graph.facebook.com/?ids=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/
Additionally, there is a special identifier me which refers to the current user. So the URL https://graph.facebook.com/me returns the active user's profile.

Pictures
You can render the current profile photo for any object by adding the suffix /picture to the object URL. For example, this will render your public profile photo:
<img src="https://graph.facebook.com/0/picture"/>

The same URL pattern works for all objects in the graph:

People: http://graph.facebook.com/0/picture
Events: http://graph.facebook.com/331218348435/picture
Groups: http://graph.facebook.com/69048030774/picture
Pages: http://graph.facebook.com/DoloresPark/picture
Applications: http://graph.facebook.com/2318966938/picture
Photo Albums: http://graph.facebook.com/platform/picture

You can specify the picture size you want with the type argument, which should be one of square (50x50), small (50 pixels wide, variable height), normal (100 pixels wide, variable height), and large (about 200 pixels wide, variable height): http://graph.facebook.com/0/picture?type=large.
If you need a picture to be returned over a secure connection, you can set the return_ssl_resources argument to 1: http://graph.facebook.com/0/picture?return_ssl_resources=1.
Paging
When querying connections, there are several useful parameters that enable you to filter and page through connection data:

limit, offset: https://graph.facebook.com/me/likes?limit=3
until, since (a unix timestamp or any date accepted by strtotime): https://graph.facebook.com/search?until=yesterday&q=orange

Dates
All date fields are returned as ISO-8601 formatted strings.  You can optionally override the date format by specifying a "date_format" query parameter.  The accepted format strings are identical to those accepted by the php date function.  For example, http://graph.facebook.com/platform/feed?date_format=U returns the Platform page's feed, with unixtime-formatted dates.
Introspection
The Graph API supports introspection of objects, which enables you to see all of the connections an object has without knowing its type ahead of time. To get this information, add metadata=1 to the object URL, and the resulting JSON will include a metadata property that lists all the supported connections for the given object. For example, you can see all the connections for the Developer Garage event above by fetching https://graph.facebook.com/331218348435?metadata=1. That outputs:
{
   "name": "Facebook Developer Garage Austin - SXSW Edition",
   "metadata": {
      "connections": {
         "feed": "http://graph.facebook.com/331218348435/feed",
         "picture": "https://graph.facebook.com/331218348435/picture",
         "invited": "https://graph.facebook.com/331218348435/invited",
         "attending": "https://graph.facebook.com/331218348435/attending",
         "maybe": "https://graph.facebook.com/331218348435/maybe",
         "noreply": "https://graph.facebook.com/331218348435/noreply",
         "declined": "https://graph.facebook.com/331218348435/declined"
      }
   }
}

The introspection feature is a useful and extensible way to find all the things your users are connected to.
Real-Time updates
Real-time updates provide you the ability to receive updates about all of your application's users, as their data changes.  With such subscriptions, you can be confident that your cached data is correct without polling Facebook's servers, increasing the reliability of your application, and the responsiveness of your user experience.
Searching
You can search over all public objects in the social graph with https://graph.facebook.com/search. The format is:
https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=QUERY&type=OBJECT_TYPE

We support search for the following types of objects:

All public posts: https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=watermelon&type=post
People: https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=mark&type=user
Pages: https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=platform&type=page
Events: https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=conference&type=event
Groups: https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=programming&type=group
Places: https://graph.facebook.com/search?q=coffee&type=place&center=37.76,122.427&distance=1000
Checkins: https://graph.facebook.com/search?type=checkin

You can restrict the fields returned by these searches using the ?fields= URL parameter, in the same way you can when reading other objects. For example, to get only the names of events, you can do the following:

Event Names: https://graph.facebook.com/search?fields=name&q=conference&type=event

Some fields such as id, and start_time for events, are always returned.
You can also search an individual user's News Feed, restricted to that user's friends, by adding a q argument to the home connection URL:

News Feed: https://graph.facebook.com/me/home?q=facebook

When searching for public posts or posts on the user's News Feed, you can page over the results by using the since, until and limit parameters. since and until both accept a unix timestamp. When paging back in time, you should use until in conjunction with limit where until is the unixtime value of the created_time field in the last object returned by your previous query. When paging forward in time you should set since to be the unixtime value of the created_time field in the first object returned by your previous query.


Publishing
You can publish to the Facebook graph by issuing HTTP POST requests to the appropriate connection URLs, using an access token.  For example, you can post a new wall post on Arjun's wall by issuing a POST request to https://graph.facebook.com/arjun/feed:
curl -F 'access_token=...' \
     -F 'message=Hello, Arjun. I like this new API.' \
     https://graph.facebook.com/arjun/feed

The Graph API reference provides more detailed information on the supported arguments and their corresponding values.
You can comment on or like any object that has a /comments or /likes connection by posting to https://graph.facebook.com/OBJECT_ID/comments and https://graph.facebook.com/OBJECT_ID/likes, respectively:
curl -F 'access_token=...' \
     https://graph.facebook.com/313449204401/likes

Most write operations require extended permissions for the active user. See the authentication guide for details on how you can request extended permissions from the user during the authentication step.
We support writing the following types of objects:


Method
Description
Arguments


/PROFILE_ID/feed
Publish a new post on the given profile's feed/wall
message, picture, link, name, caption, description, source


/OBJECT_ID/comments
Comment on the given object (if it has a /comments connection)
message


/OBJECT_ID/likes
Like the given object (if it has a /likes connection)
none


/PROFILE_ID/notes
Publish a note on the given profile
message, subject


/PROFILE_ID/links

message, source (multipart/form-data)


/PROFILE_ID/checkins
Create a checkin at a location represented by a Page
coordinates, place, message, tags




Deleting
You can delete objects in the graph by issuing HTTP DELETE requests to the object URLs, i.e,
DELETE https://graph.facebook.com/ID?access_token=... HTTP/1.1

To support clients that do not support all HTTP methods (like JavaScript clients), you can alternatively issue a POST request to an object URL with the additional argument method=delete to override the HTTP method. For example, you can delete a comment by issuing a POST request to https://graph.facebook.com/COMMENT_ID?method=delete.
You can delete a like by issuing a DELETE request to /OBJECT_ID/likes (since likes don't have an ID).

Analytics
When you register your app, you can get detailed analytics about the demographics of your users and how users are sharing from your application with Insights.
The Graph API provides programmatic access to all of this data so you can integrate Platform data into your own, custom analytics systems.
To download Insights data, you first need to obtain an app access token.
Once you have your application access token, you can download analytics data for your application at:
https://graph.facebook.com/app_id/insights?access_token=...
That URL outputs all of the analytics data available via the API, including the total number of users, number of active users, and a number of other detailed metrics. For example, you can get the number of impressions of your app's canvas page:
https://graph.facebook.com/app_id/insights/application_canvas_views/day?access_token=...
You can use since and until to specify the time range for which you want data. Both arguments accept times in almost any valid date format:
https://graph.facebook.com/app_id/insights?access_token=...&since=yesterday
Explore the Insights product, the base /insights URL, and the Insights documentation for more information.
Batch Requests
If your app needs the ability to access significant amounts of data or make changes to several objects at once, it is more efficient to combine these operations than to make multiple HTTP requests.
To batch requests, please refer to our documentation.
ConceptsObjectsConceptsBatch RequestsIf your application needs the ability to access significant amounts of data in a single go - or you need to make changes to several objects at once, it is often more efficient batch your queries rather than make multiple individual HTTP requests. To enable this, the Graph API support Batching. Batching allows you to pass instructions for several operations in a single HTTP request.
PermissionsPermissions to access GRAPH API fields and connections.
Real-time UpdatesThe Graph API supports real-time updates to enable your application using Facebook to subscribe to changes in data from Facebook.  Your application caches data and receives updates, rather than polling Facebook’s servers.  Caching data and using this API can improve the reliability of your application and decrease its load times.
