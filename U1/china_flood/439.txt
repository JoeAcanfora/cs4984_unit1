Agency Compensation and Management Practices Survey Conducted by Ward Group 

Ward Group® is conducting a survey on agency compensation practices for property-casualty insurance companies. The information gathered from the survey will provide meaningful insights on agency compensation, commission structures, incentives, travel and other agency management practices. The survey will be conducted through December 1, 2011 and results will be distributed in January 2012. 
"Agency compensation is one of the largest operating components P&C companies must manage," says Jeffrey Rieder, President of Ward Group. "This study will provide valuable information to help companies evaluate agency management practices and design compensation systems that are competitive and drive agent behavior."
Participating companies will receive a summary of findings including best practice considerations and a complete benchmarking appendix comparing participants' results to benchmark groups for easy review. Participants are also invited to attend a webinar presentation of key findings.
The cost to participate in the survey is $850. The participation fee is waived for companies currently enrolled in a Ward Group benchmarking program. The deadline to submit the completed survey is December 1, 2011. Property-casualty insurance companies interested in participating should contact Matt Ryan at mryan@wardinc.com or call 513-746-2436.
