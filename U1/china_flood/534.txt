Obama's Jobs Speech: He Can Inspire Hope and Confidence By 'Getting Ugly' (Joe Rothstein's Commentary)
September 3, 2011
By Joe Rothstein
Editor, EINNEWS.com

If you're President, and a Democrat, you have to please the Social Democrats, the Labor Democrats, the Green Democrats, the Blue Dog Democrats, the Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the Rural Caucus and others who come to the table with their own constituencies and agendas based on what they consider their own primary interests.

If you're a Republican and President,  the seats at that table belong to the Libertarians, the Christian Conservatives, the NeoCons, the Constitutional Conservatives, the NRA, and the business interests represented by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable---not to be confused with the  business interests represented by a myriad of small business groups. 

Then there are interests not easily pegged as partisans, but no less important: agriculture, military, defense contracting, senior citizens, consumer groups, child welfare groups and the like.

Whether they fall into the Democratic or Republican columns there are a boat load of non-trivial differences among these groups.  It's difficult to please some supporters without offending others.  
So give our presidents some slack.  They lead a diverse nation, one where after "provide or the common defense," the definition of "we," as in "we the people," can get awfully murky.

President Obama has been given a lot of slack by his key support system.  Unions stayed with him even as he backed away from fighting for many items at the top of their wish list.  Hispanics stayed with him even though he didn't give high priority to a comprehensive immigration bill.  Afro-Americans stayed with him even as black unemployment climbed to a rate double the percentage of out of work white workers. 

The President, at the peak of his power and authority, watered down the initial stimulus plan.  He caved early on some of the most important features of health reform.  He traded away extension of the Bush tax cuts for high income earners.  Environmental groups have bit their lips over luke warm White House efforts to stem global warming, and this week gnashed their teeth over administration support for the oil shale pipeline and its retreat on ozone regulations. 

Small wonder that as we approach 2012 most of the constituencies that helped Barrack Obama become President are now registering somewhere between disappointment and apoplexy on the Obama support scale.

The President is seriously behind the curve with his own supporters as we enter what traditionally is the kick-off period for the 2012 presidential election.  But the game isn't over.  He has one more chance to score, and to score big.  It may be his last chance.

That chance will come in a few days when he delivers a jobs program to Congress and to the public.  He gets that chance because the jobs picture is so grim.  How grim? It blows away all other issues.  Today it's right up there with "provide for the common defense" in uniting Americans.  

If the President outlines a vision for what can be done---right now and over the next few years---to refocus the economy on growth, a vision that inspires hope and restores confidence, and

if he follows up with specific ideas for achieving growth---ideas that sound reasonable to a skeptical public, and

if he embarks on a year-long effort to win public approval for those ideas, legislative support for those ideas, administrative implementation where he has the authority, and judicial approval where needed, the President can uplift the spirit of the nation, put people back to work and save his presidency.

To do that President Obama, paraphrasing Texas Governor Perry, has to treat the Republican leaders in Congress "pretty ugly."

He has to call them out on killing hundreds of thousands of public service jobs so far and millions more public and private jobs now on the chopping block.  He has to place blame for the downgrading of U.S. debt squarely in their lap.  He has to make the case that their insistence on deep cuts during this time of economic distress is lunacy and that their opposition to any revenue increases at all is a short cut to economic disaster. 

Furthermore, the President has to call for a return to a time where issues were decided on their merits, not on legislative hostage-taking, and that requiring 60 votes to get anything at all done in the Senate is anathema in a nation built on the principle of majority rule.

Finally, the President has to realize that he's going to lose most of the fights he picks.  But if he's persuasive enough with the public he will win some of them, and he has the power to set the tone for 2012 that will help reasonable people make reasonable arguments as they campaign for public office.  

Barack Obama often talks about "teachable moments." Unfortunately, he himself has proven to be a slow learner.

When your opponents say that their top priority in life is to chase you out of office and to see that you fail, that's a "teachable moment." When they put up the barricades of total resistance to everything you propose, that's a lot of "teachable moments." When they call you a liar, and even question your own birth certificate, those are "teachable moments."

And if Barack Obama hasn't processed that message by now and doesn't come out with all oratoracal guns blazing for his jobs speech and every day thereafter he will have another teachable moment.  

That lesson: If you don't fight you don't win.  You don't win now. You don't win in November 2012.
