 'Samir' I said as we drove out of Ramallah heading back to Jerusalem, 'can you call your contacts and see if anythings going on?'Samir, our Palestinian bureau producer here, rang his West Bank contacts to see if anything was going on. 'They say there's nothing going on' he said as we drove into a cloud of thick black smoke, and large stones thrown by teenagers skittered along the road beside our vehicle....

The countdown for the diplomatic car crash of a vote on Palestinian statehood is still on track, but some countries opposed to it are working to ensure the route goes through the labyrinth of United Nations corridors and gets lost along the way.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has vowed he will lodge the application for full UN membership with secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon on Friday.That in itself is enough to cause diplomatic fallout,...

Palestine Observes Its Status

When is a State not a State? When it's a UN 'Observer State? When it's an 'entity' which calls itself a State? When the UN General Assembly says so? These and other murky questions will become either clearer or far more complicated next week when the 193 members of the United Nations meet in New York for the annual General Assembly or 'Unga' as it is called....

Libya: Don't Say 'Mission Accomplished'.

When the British government was confident that the rebel advances in Libya were irreversible, some officials and politicians were in triumphant mood.The word soon came from Downing Street and the Foreign Office not to take a triumphal tone with the media. There would be no We told you so briefings.Prime Minister David Cameron may have pulled off a risky policy of intervention, but the experience of Iraq had scarred wise heads....

Cairo: Saudi Embassy Attacked

Not many people know this, but the Israeli Embassy was not the only one attacked in Cairo last weekend.The Embassy of Saudi Arabia was also stormed by a mob. Strangely the Egyptian media mostly kept quiet about it. The Muslim Brotherhood, which welcomed the assault on the 'murderous Nazi Jewish invaders' had nothing to say about the Saudi incident.Several cars were set alight but there was only minor damage to the building. however, it begs the question - why the Saudi Embassy?...

The crimes of the Gaddafi dictatorship are legion and well documented, the brutality of the anti Gaddafi forces this year less so, until now.Amnesty International (of which I am a member) has published a 107 page report 'The Battle For Libya' which accuses both sides of war crimes.The report notes that by far the majority of atrocities were carried out by the Gaddafi side but also catalogues those committed by the rebels and warns that these may be continuing....

Cairo: Israeli Embassy Attack Planned

Tim Marshall


The storming of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo on Friday night was not just planned, it was part of a 60 year campaign of hate which has permeated all levels of Egyptian society and which the current chaos in Egypt is allowing full rein.On the surface the attack was in revenge for the killing of several Egyptian security forces mistakenly shot by the Israelis. The IDF was pursuing a terrorist gang which had killed Israelis in the Eilat region last month....

It's official. After years of speculation the British Foreign Secretary has confirmed the presence of at least one snake deep inside the Foreign Office and hinted that elsewhere in Whitehall many others may be loose slithering about various departments hissing at passing civil servants and journalists.In a speech, given amid the splendour of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, William Hague revealed that there is a 20 foot long anaconda in the building....

About this blog
 Foreign Matters tries to join the dots and tell it like it is. Positions? It takes them. Debates? It makes them. Some blogs will use the language of diplomats without translation, Foreign Matters seeks to explain that a Working Group is 5 or more people sitting in a room failing to achieve anything, and a Bi-lateral is a meeting involving two people chatting.Follow Tim Marshall on
