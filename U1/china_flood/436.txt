SMAA Issues Reminder for Record Date for Pre-Split Shares 

 SMA Alliance, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: SMAA), the leader in cutting edge software generating unprecedented traffic to retailers of the automotive industry at local and national levels, issued a reminder to its shareholders today that the last day to own shares to be effective in the 10 for 1 split is Friday, September 23, 2011 at 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.
The record date and the effective date for the shareholders of record to participate in the 10 for 1 split of its common stock will expire at 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time on Friday, September 23rd, 2011. 
Shareholders of record at this time will receive 10 common shares for each share owned. 
"Through our combined technology and applications with our web property USAutoplex.com, each dealer on our program could double and even quintuple their revenues in the first month of subscribing to USAutoplex.com," stated Anthony Baker, CEO of SMA Alliance, Inc. "We are excited to offer the ability to allow shareholders a greater ability to participate in our success and reflect our growth in the markets."
As reported from previous release, USAutoplex.com is a website which indexes and presents each automobile dealer's real-time inventory in one location, making automobiles easily searchable based on very expansive search criteria, suited for all types of car shoppers. USAutoplex.com, combined with SMAA technology, pulls and aggregates the majority of local buying and selling demand for automobiles into USAutoplex.com specifically for each dealer subscribed to USAutoplex.com, in each local market. 
Built on SMAA technology and scalable to be the largest automotive inventory website in the world, company officials expect USAutoplex.com to develop approximately 24 million dollars in annual revenues by the close of the NADA conference held in Las Vegas in February 2012.
SMA Alliance, Inc. (SMAA) is a software and application company aggregating local buying demand for businesses.
