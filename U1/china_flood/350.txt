It's A Fare Cop

As a regular train commuter I'm still waiting to witness a ticket inspector carry out that well-publicised threat to fine or excess-charge anyone travelling without a valid ticket.My experience is that the inspectors are only too ready to sell a transgressor a ticket mid-journey, rather than risk an embarrassing confrontation in a packed carriage. Maybe it's just the lack of real oiks on the 8.10 to Victoria, though I meet plenty on the late-night vomit comet when I'm working late....

The police have purposely avoided using the word 'artist' as they launch an appeal for help in identifying the "owner of a graffiti tag" who's accused of causing £1 million damage. Apparently "the author of this tag" has been busy in North London and Westminster, and prolific across sidings on the tube network.Houses, schools, monuments and old folks' homes have been targeted with the ZERX tag....

No More Free Sport For Top Cop

Top cop Ian McPherson is going to have to pay to get into top sporting events from now on after quitting Scotland Yard.The Assistant Commissioner announced his imminent retirement just a few hours before the publication of the Met's hospitality register which revealed the freebies he accepted in the past year.They included TWO tickets for Wimbledon, Royal Ascot, an England rugby international, and the Guinness rugby premiership final.Plus a single ticket to an Arsenal match and the BBC Proms....

The Time The New Met Chief Flattened Me

The last Scotland Yard commissioner told me before he got the job that he wouldn’t be applying for it if he thought it was going to be "five years of damage limitation".Well, Sir Paul Stephenson lasted less than three years and, if he wasn’t always on the back foot, he found he rarely got public acknowledgement for successes like crime reduction and a trouble-free royal wedding.Bernard Hogan-Howe, a no-nonsense and blunt-speaking Yorkshireman,...

Madeleine Cops In Portugal

They may not have welcomed the order from Downing Street to launch an investigation into Madeleine McCann's disappearance, but at least Scotland Yard detectives have made a first visit to Portugual.I can't imagine they were given a warm welcome by their Portuguese colleagues whose work (failure to solve the mystery) the Met team is reviewing.Still, it's a step in the right direction and officially the two groups met "with very good co-operation and liaison will continue....

Too Much Too Young?

The boss of the Barnardo's charity said the court had over-reacted in its treatment of an 11-year-old who was caught nicking a waste bin from a smashed up store during the riots, but what do you think?The youngest rioter in London took the bin after others had smashed the windows of Debenhams in Romford, causing £6,000 worth of damage, on the night of widespread trouble.Five days earlier he'd admitted trying to set fire to a bus,...

Riots - The bill so far.....

The cost of policing the riots in London hasn't come cheap...£34 million so far.It's the price paid for swamping the streets with cops (don't forget that was the Yard's idea, not No 10's!).It's made up of normal operational costs, plus overtime for Met cops and payments to the hundreds of officers drafted in from most of the other forces in England and Wales. And feeding them all....

Predictably, he became known as Champagne Charlie, but who were the real charlies?Homeless pensioner John Clugston (above) posed as a businessman and toured offices offering cheap bottles of Bollinger champagne that he said had been left over from a work function.All you had to do was give him a grand or so in cash and he would go off and come back with the bubbly.Only he never came back. Surprise, surprise.Apparently he got away with it 28 times over several months,...

Jersey - Safe Place Or Crime Capital?

The detective in charge of the Jersey stabbings describes the island as "probably one of the safest places in the western world."He points out the last murder on the island was in 2004.Well, I reckon that since early 2008 I've probably spent more time reporting crime in Jersey than I have anywhere else outside London.The latest murder spree, the Curtis Warren drugs trial and the Haut de la Garenne child abuse investigation have all been very high-profile cases,...

There were no planes, so the three of us piled into a tiny, chartered cabin cruiser for a six-hour, midnight dash from Weymouth through choppy seas to Jersey.Our crew of two seemed to delight in pushing the boat at up to 25 knots as it weaved between massive tankers and ferries.We were so sick and exhausted when we arrived we considered turning off our moblies so the newsdesk might think we had perished and leave us alone....

About this blog
Someone once said that a journalist's job offers a front-row seat at the peep show of life. True. And even more so for a crime reporter. All human life is on my beat. It's a world of villains, heroes, heartache and triumph over adversity. And that's just the scene around my family breakfast table before I set off for work.My job can be as dull as everyone else's, but not very often. Most of the time it's fascinating.And I've often thought the most interesting stuff is what happens before, after and around the story that you see on the telly.My Life of Crime diary, or blog as I'm learning to call it, aims to bring you all that. I will write it up as often as time permits. And I'd like to hear your views. Again, I'll respond when I can. Oh, and if you have any stories for me to report please email me or 'blog' them to me.... Preferably, stories in the Maldives.The pavement outside Scotland Yard is often cold and wet. And that's in July.
