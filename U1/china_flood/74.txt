BEIJING -- More than 5 million people have been displaced or otherwise affected by flooding in eastern China that is also pushing up food prices, state media reported Sunday.
Torrential rains have left huge areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces under water, with more than 1 million acres (432,200 hectares) of farmland inundated, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
Almost 1,000 businesses have been forced to suspend operations and 5.7 million people have had their lives disrupted, Xinhua said in a brief report. More than 7,000 homes collapsed or were otherwise damaged and direct financial damage was estimated at almost 6 billion yuan ($930 million).
The downpour triggered a mudslide that buried houses and killed two people in Zhejiang's Changshan county, while two more were killed and two left missing by flooding in Hubei, Xinhua said.
Flooding in eastern and southern China this month has left more than 170 people dead or missing. Roads and railways have been blocked, but aid supplies are arriving and the country's weather bureau says skies are expected to clear up Monday.
Farmers quoted by Xinhua said the flooding was the worst in 20 years, reducing vegetable output by 20 percent and also causing shortages of fruits and grains. Prices for green vegetables were up 40 percent, Xinhua said, adding to an inflation rate of 5.5 percent, a three-year high.
The increase in the consumer price index reported last week was in line with expectations but higher than April's 5.3 percent and March's 5.4 percent. The National Statistics Bureau said the main factor was an 11.7 percent jump in food prices.
Higher food prices blamed on flooding were also reported in the eastern provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, Xinhua said.

				Just over a week ago there were many China bashers attacking the Three Gorges Dam as the cause for the 50 year drought that was affecting the same provinces as the flood region now.   I shall love to hear from the same people how the 3GD is the cause of the floods now.

This much should be evident.  During the drought the 3GD had impounded water that was used to alleviate the drought.  Without the dam there would not be any available water at all. As another commentator said (5 millions flooded out) everything in China is large numbers.  That impounded water still barely made an impression on the parched lands as it affected several tens of thousands of square miles.

Now we have this 50 year flood.  Again without the 3GD to hold back the up river waters, had the rainstorms reached the upper reaches of the Yangtze, the floods downriver would have been even more devastating and affect an even bigger area.  No the rains haven't reached there yet.  But at least there is the very significant comfort that should it rain excessively there the runoff won't reach downriver unrestricted to add to the downriver miseries.  Any overabundance of water can be be held back by the 3GD  for a controlled release.  Nothing much can be done to control the current downriver floods. With the 3GD it is assured that it won't get any worse.

				NATURAL DISASTERS?

Electric cars, light bulbs and solar panels won't change anything as weather becomes extreme. It will worsen as China and India's 2,500,000,000 people move up the success ladder and demand more energy.

Check all earth sciences and you will discover everything in the process of collapse due to over population of the planet including starvation, which has been going on for years, will pick up momentum.

Dufar in the Sudan looks on the surface to be ethnic cleansing. Next time you look, look not at the starving people but the desert they live in that won't support the winners of this war.

The Sahara is moving south at 20 miles a year. Soon they will all starve while in China, 37% of the ground water is not fit for human consumption and 34% of that is not fit for irrigation.

Because people continue reproducing at a breakneck pace, They refuse to recognize that this planet cant sustain 7,300,000,000 devouring everything like a plague of locus in a wheat field.

Extreme weather at this point is beyond human reach to repair it. Its picking up momentum as anything does when going down hill. We don't have 100's of years left in spite of what many people want to believe.

The planet will continue to heat up for the next several thousand years since it is now running on automatic and regardless of what you hear not much can be done about it.

				Hope the people are found and returned to normal soon. If the region is a natural flood zone or new farming district, did the dams impact natural flow of water? Is the draining system updated to all connect and filter somewhere needed? To sump pump it out and put where lacking water would make sense,pooled and filtered.  Could the crops be pulled from the water and transplanted to other regions or rooftops to grow?  May the wasted infrared glasses around here be put to better use with the military on after storm units for trouble as this .   Move the displaced into hotels nearby. Dievs to you. ~ Maija from Detroit

Also, where in the world are you getting your information on the left?  You wonder why you're constantly referring to us as elitist... look at the kind of ignorance you bring to the table.  A tadpole would seem elite next to you!

				My prayers go out for the people who are mostly poor in the agricultural areas. It will be interesting to see if China asks for help from its allies--not us---or if we can balance our trade deficit with China by sending them our produce at higher prices too, esp since they play monopoly with their yen to our dollar. I would like to see the Arabs, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and Mexico and the other countries that China is cozying up with me offer assistance.
