Jordan's Aqaba Port Thrives Amid Region's Instability...The fortunes of the port, which is wedged between Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and is Jordan's only outlet to the sea, have fluctuated from boom to bust over the last several decades with every major political upheaval.

There was a golden era in the mid-1980s, when the port serviced Iraq during its eight-year war with Iran, and then a near-complete standstill during a U.S. naval blockade and United Nations sanctions in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The last watershed was a boom after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. (reuters.com)
