President Obama's Jobs Speech: Neither Michelle Nor the Gods Seemed Pleased (Joe Rothstein's Commentary)
September 9, 2011

By Joe Rothstein

Some observations about the President's jobs speech.

Michelle Obama's body language was striking.  She seemed sullen, if not downright angry.  The only smile the TV camera revealed was as she left the gallery, which I interpreted as relief that the speech was over and that she could go home.  I've never seen this before in a First Lady on such an occasion.

Am I reading too much into this?  Maybe she and the President just argued over his failure to replace the cap on the toothpaste.  Or maybe she's fed up with the way the whole White House experience is going---and not looking forward to climbing back into the campaign arena.  Worth paying attention. 

Another piece of minutia.  The President was wearing a purple tie.  The Vice President's was roughly similar, but more on the lavender scale.  Not blue or red as usual.  Red and blue get associated with states that reliably vote Democratic or Republican.   Purple, on the other hand, shows up on maps for states like Nevada, Virginia, Iowa and others that might go either way.  Maybe just a wardrobe coincidence.  But in a White House meticulous about backgrounds and choreography, you can bet that they also pay attention to dress and the messages viewers read into it.

It's worth noting that the camera, by pre-arrangement no doubt, showed shots of members of the President's "Council on Jobs and Competitiveness" who were in the gallery.  The chairman of that group is Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and CEO of GE, a company that pays no taxes despite its billions in profits, and exports countless jobs overseas.  Immelt supports the program the President laid out in his speech. Should the rest of us worry about that?

 The headline takeaways from the speech are that Obama proposed a $450 billion jobs program.  But only $200 billion would be new spending.  The rest is the budget impact of not collecting taxes that would otherwise be paid.  Here's my question: Why when Obama or the Democrats propose a tax cut is it considered a "cost," but when the Republicans propose a tax cut it isn't?  Republicans insist that tax cuts generate revenue, they don't cost anything.  Apparently the media buys into that Republicans framing.

To be consistent, shouldn't the media have labeled last year's extension of the Bush tax cuts a "$1.5 trillion cost"?  Shouldn't all the Republican proposals now on the table, such as lowering of capital gains, be considered "costs"?  And If they are proposing so much in the way of big cuts (costs) shouldn't they be considered the big spenders?

Another observation: Senate Minority Leader McConnell has no intention of letting the program proposed by the President become law.

Let's review the McConnell record.

Before the President spoke last night McConnell took the floor of the Senate to denounce the President's program as a "campaign" program, not a "jobs" program.  He essentially declared it dead on arrival before it was even delivered.

This is consistent with McConnell's position through the entire Obama presidency.  I heard him speak at the National Press Club within weeks of Obama's inaugural and he essentially told us, in terms only slightly more polite than Rush Limbaugh, that he hoped Obama would fail.  McConnell has never really accepted the fact that Obama is President and certainly has never done much, in nearly three years, to help enact anything that Obama has proposed.   Mostly, he stands at the gates, filibuster in hand, ready to stop all but the most essential traffic from getting through.  Don't expect anything different from him now.

Which brings me to Republican comments about the new job creation plan. They uniformly make the claim that past stimulus efforts "didn't work."

This is the common perception, of course.  Repeated enough, nearly anything can be accepted as true----even death panels.  But in the world where real people live most economists credit the original stimulus efforts with heading off a genuine depression and stopping the economic free fall that Obama inherited from the Bush administration.

The "didn't work" canard is usually preceded by the equally spurious claim that "we tried it."  It's important to define the "we." The Republicans voted en mass against it.  They were no part of the "we." They didn't vote to save the banks, the auto industry, the many states that were facing bankruptcy, or any of the other remedies put in place to keep a desperate economic situation from becoming a calamity.  In fact, the original stimulus efforts were watered down to inadequacy because of total Republican resistance.

To continue this thread of realism, nothing the President proposed last night is likely to drive down unemployment numbers by much.  We're facing a much bigger hole than he intends to fill.  At best, his proposals might head off a double dip recession and keep jobless numbers from getting even worse.  His plan is not a big vision under whose flag armies of supporters can enthusiastically rally.  

Which maybe is why Michelle Obama didn't look very happy.  She's smart enough to know that the President was eloquently proposing band-aids when tourniquets are needed. 

This likely will not be enough to satisfy a worried and angry country.  While the President spoke, lightning bolts crashed down around the Capitol in a dramatic summer storm.  You can't miss the symbolism. The President was not satisfying the worried and angry Gods of nature, either.
