Ruby Creek Adds Chief Geologist to the Team 

  Ruby Creek Resources, Inc. (OTCBB: RBYC), a gold exploration and mining company with operations in Tanzania, is pleased to announce Mr. Jan Serfontein has joined Ruby Creek as Chief Geologist.
For over two decades Mr. Serfontein has explored for a wide range of precious and base metals in many African countries. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology and Honors Bachelor of Science degree in Exploration Geology from the University of Pretoria. Following work at the Geological Survey of South Africa, Rocklabs, South African Development Trust Corporation, Jan co-founded VSA Earth Science Consultants, which rendered a specialized service in selected Earth Science disciplines. In 1997 he initiated the incorporation of VSA GeoConsultants, Caser Construction, VSA Uganda and VSA Tanzania into Set Point Technology Holdings, a Johannesburg Stock Exchange listed company, where Jan assumed the role of Divisional Director. Following a successful management buy-out of the entire VSA Division in July 2000, the VSA GeoConsultants Group was established, of which he was the Chief Executive Officer until 2008, when the Company merged with a Canadian major (Golder). During this time his appointments included Country Manager (Geology and Mining) Uganda, Tanzania, Sierra Leone and Angola for Canadian and British companies, Diamond Works and Branch Energy (in both hard rock and alluvial settings).
Jan co-founded the platinum exploration company Blue Sky Exploration, which successfully reverse listed on the London Alternative Exchange as Cluff Platinum. His work at Blue Sky resulted in the discovery of the Blue Ridge platinum mine (http://www.aquariusplatinum.com). He co-founded UIS Analytical Services, arguably one of the largest privately owned analytical laboratories in Africa.
Beginning in early October, Jan is leading the exploration of the entire Gold Plateau area. Additionally a production exploration program will be started on the areas of Ruby Creek's planned mining licenses. The initial goal of the program is to explore and prove up a reportable 200,000 inferred ounces of gold. Additionally the geological team will map the area's high grade zones, often found in placer deposits, to guide production of those zones. Followed by a full-scale Project program delineating potential reserves while looking for possible source rock for hard rock drill targets. Jan is working with the technical team in designing and equipping the onsite laboratory located at the Gold Plateau Camp, for quickly processing ore samples for internal evaluation. He will also be identifying other experienced technical talent to join the geology team.
Robert Slavik, President and CEO of Ruby Creek, said, "We have extensively searched the mining space for geologists with strong capabilities and experiences to lead both placer and hard rock exploration. Jan has great experience in a wide range of deposit types. He was recently onsite at the Gold Plateau and was quite impressed with our Project both in its large expanse of gold showings on the property with the possibility of identifying and discovering multiple source hard rock targets. Looking at Jan's experience and accomplishments, I am very pleased to announce that he has joined our team as our full time Chief Geologist. We are all looking forward to his leadership in the exploration and development of our Gold Plateau Project."
