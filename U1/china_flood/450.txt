Top Seattle SEO Firm Continues to Dominate SERPs and Signs Top Online Properties/EINPresswire.com/ When you type in "SEO Seattle" or "Seattle SEO" into Google, expect to see the Top Search Engine Marketing Firm in Seattle pop up: Seattle Organic SEO.  In less than 3 very short months, this online boutique agency jumped to the first page of many critical search engine results and in 8 months landed in the #1 position for the highly sought after phrase "Seattle SEO."  

How did they do it?  Well, many clients are lining up to find out and hiring this agency which tries to make this complicated search engine algorithm as simple as possible.  The firm's founder and Principal Brandon Na says, "We've always made huge efforts to break down the complicated to the most simplest of concepts and have applied these strategies to help our clients garner incredible year over year growth.  We're incredibly proud of one of our e-commerce clients which recently reached just shy of 250% year over year website growth with the traffic generated by their organic keywords."  

And it's not just small business who's trying to get this SEO firm to assist them with this critical part of online marketing these days, but websites which are dominating Social Media are also knocking at the company's door.  DoubleDown Casino, the world's top free online casino has hired Na's firm to add to their incredible growth over the past year which has landed the company, the 5th fastest growing online Facebook game by AppData the week of August 17th, 2011.  

A couple months before, Seattle Organic SEO (SOS) also began energizing the efforts of Real Network's Film.com.  A partner of top web developer Ratio Interactive, Seattle Organic SEO revamped some of the critical variables which affect SEO on the Movies Reviews website which could be considered the "Rolling Stone of Film."  In literally months with the top Cinema portal, search traffic increased 19% and the mix of phrases that were generating organic traffic shot up to over 106 thousand phrases from the original 57 thousand phrases that were mostly made up of branded keywords.  Na humbly downplays the achievements by saying, "While it's exciting to see the immediate gains from our efforts, SEO is a long term marketing strategy.  We know our client's needs are to move the traffic dial from day 1, but we have been lucky to work with great clients who understand that it takes a long time to effectively improve what we ultimately hope to accomplish for them."  Na continues, "We are constantly seeking to enhance our client's traffic and produce more streams of revenue so they prosper long term.  If we're not helping them improve their bottom line, we don't feel like we've done our job."  

In a matter of just 3+ quarters of a year, SOS has represented small to medium sized companies in many industries which had anywhere from hundreds of visits a day to as many as millions a day before hiring SOS.  In addition to Film and DoubleDown, the list of companies include Architects, Blogging Celebrities, Broadcasting, Continuing Education, eCommerce, Luxury Watches, Plastic Tanks, Womens' Fashion, Event Marketing, Handyman Services, Home Inspection, Home Remodeling, Graphic Designers, Jewelers, Locksmith, Pest Control, Painting, Photographers, Plumbers, Travel Social Networking, Veterinary Hospitals, and Website Designers & Developers. 

"It's exciting to see what we've done in less than a year.  However, we're always striving to do even more.  We would like to write a book for all those hard working small business people out there about SEO and explain it in terms they can relate to.  Earlier during the year, we sponsored and hosted an event called "Codename: SIMPLE" with an amazing Social Media company Project Bionic, International Blogger John Chow and one of the most incredible moderators in the country: Red Russak.  We're always doing our best to make sure all sectors of society are reaping the rewards of what we believe is a rare time in business history.   Never have there been more efficient and more effective strategies that are available to small and large businesses alike.  Using SEO, Paid Search and many great Social Media strategies can truly take a one person operation and turn them into an overnight success competing with the likes of the biggest brands in society.  We want to be a part of that success," says Na about SOS's hopes for the upcoming year.
