"It's not about whether the floods will come again. If we don't clear the things, we will not be able to use them again."Two towns were flooded and thousands were evacuated following the breach of two dykes in Zhuji on Thursday.China has mobilised troops across the region to rescue stricken farmers and distribute food, but some villagers said the local government could have done more to prevent the flooding."When it first started, the breach [in the flood protection dyke] was not that huge - we could have easily fixed it," said 22-year old villager Shou Qiongdan."But the government did not do anything. None of the local officials tried to salvage the situation. That's why we have such huge economic losses and so many people being affected by the flooding."In neighbouring Jiangsu province, the city of Suzhou was hit by more than 200 mm of rainfall on Friday night, and water at the Tai Lake had already exceeded flood alert levels, the China News Service said.In central China's Hubei, two people were killed after the Yangtze river and its tributaries burst their banks, with as many as three million people affected, Xinhua said in a separate report. Further downstream in Anhui province, three died and another 120,000 were evacuated as a result of floods.In southwest China's Sichuan province, five people were killed and another seven remain missing after a water diversion tunnel was flooded on Friday, the China News Service said.Reuters
