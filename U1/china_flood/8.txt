More rain has hit central China's Hunan Province disrupting the lives of at least one million residents. 
Torrential rains in the province have driven up river-water levels. 
In Lishui city, levels rose more than two meters in one day. And major streets are still flooded in Xinhua County, where rain-damage has cut off power supplies and access to clean drinking water. 
Heavy downpours have also caused landslides destroying more than one thousand five hundred homes. 
Meanwhile, residents have been evacuated from Loudi City and almost fifty smaller towns. The weekend's storms have been the heaviest to hit Hunan since the start of the annual rainy season.
