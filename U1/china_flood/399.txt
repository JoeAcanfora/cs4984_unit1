Cage Fighting Kids

Colin Brazier


 The NSPCC and police want us to worry about cage-fighting kids.On the face of it - they have to be right - don't they?You'd be compelled to say - at first glance - that putting eight-year-olds into an enclosed ring and letting them hit seven bells out of one another has to be barbaric: the hallmark of an increasingly amoral society.But look deeper.The kids are not allowed to punch or kick, as they would if adults. The bout is not a fight to the knockout - both boys are declared winners....

Bring Back The Cane!

 Like National Service, calls to Bring Back The Cane have an intoxicating effect on some.I am not one of them. When you peel back the complexities, such ideas - when tested - are rarely indestructible.That does not mean they should not be the subject of debate. Nor is there anything dishonourable about championing such proposals. They are certainly popular.And how. A big survey has shown this weekend that half of parents would support a return to corporal punishment for the worst behaved kids....

Doing The Dirty In Starbucks

Colin Brazier


So there I was minding my own business. It was the upstairs bit of Starbucks in one of our cathedral cities. A few metres from me sat three fellow-customers. Two young women and an older man. He was well-dressed and, judging by his spiel - a silver-tongued sheister of some talent.For legal reasons I should probably avoid specifics. But, suffice to say, in the time it took to drain my latte,...

Impregnators Are Not Fathers

 Last month Sky interviewed a 16-year-old looter. Asked why he'd stolen he replied: "For my son". Pressed by an incredulous reporter, he admitted to being little more than a boy himself. He was 16.On one level, while abhorring the crime, it is possible to admire his paternal solicitude. Want to care for your baby son mate - good on yer.But on another level, on the level where real life exists, this young man was talking out of his tush. The statistics,...

Nurses Who Can't Speak English 


September 09, 2011 8:49 AM
			 - Written by
			 
Colin Brazier


My mother worked as a nurse and she saw, in the latter stages of her career, a drift away from the idea of nursing as a vocation: a 'calling' to care for others.Instead it was becoming a profession with degrees to pass, rungs on the ladder, boxes to tick, backsides to kiss. Patients became secondary, an occupational hazard, rather than the be all and end all....

Sending Sick Kids To School

			 - Written by
			 
Colin Brazier


Working parents regularly send sick children to school because they dare not take time off work to look after them.So says a survey of 2,000 mothers polled by Haliborange, a company which makes dietary supplements. It claimed four out of ten working mums had sent their child to school even though their child really required caring for at home.Another study this week paints a similarly bleak picture for parents....

Why Is He Not Famous?

Who was the first man to travel at 1,000 miles per hour?His name was Peter Twiss, who died this week at 90. He did not just break airspeed milestones - he utterly shattered them.In 1956 he flew a Fairey Delta 2 at 1,132 miles per hour. The previous record was 822 mph.The plane had a cockpit which lowered by ten degrees for take-off and landings. The innovation made Concorde possible.I recommend that you use google images to find some pictures of this remarkable aircraft....

Princess Diana's Legacy

On the night Diana died, fourteen years ago, she was heading to Dodi Fayed's apartment off the Champs Elysees in Paris.A few weeks before the first anniversary of their deaths, I was allowed to take a film crew inside the flat.The lodgings were opulent. There were lots of beautiful ornaments. But it was gauche too. We were told nobody had been allowed to change anything there since the fatal car crash in the Pont d'Alma tunnel. It was frozen in time.... somewhere in the 1970s....

Inside The Bercow Bedroom

The strange case of Sally Bercow, wife of Parliamentary Speaker John. Strange, because most of those who submit to the televisual colliseum of Big Brother have shame to expunge or an expired career to revive. She had neither.Strange too, because it poses awkward questions about marriage.Mrs Bercow may have many talents: but most people know who she is because of her husband.And her husband is not just famous, he is embodies We The People - keeping the MPs we choose to represent Us - in order....

Of Faith And Fat

We are fat and getting fatter.So obese in fact that Britain should consider taxing sugary drinks and snacks - according to the Lancet.Using price to 'nudge' fatties away from obesity might work. Where education programmes and Jamie Oliver have failed, perhaps putting a fiver on the cost of a Mars bar might.However, the example of cigarettes is not encouraging. How many times were we told that Budget Day duties would curb our addiction to nicotine?...
