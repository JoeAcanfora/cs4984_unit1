Divine Religions started in French Chauvet Cave!/EINPresswire.com/Over 30,000 years ago, a spectacular Story of Creation was finger-puttied into the cave wall of Chauvet's Hillaire Chamber. 'Genesis of the World' appears to be a foundational cornerstone for subsequent Scripture. Indeed, religious symbolism dawned in southern France with this six meter mural. The star of this magical scene is a Winged Horse! A Universal Holy Being who symbolizes the spiritual bodies of both God and man. The first religious artifact (predating Noah's Ark and Ark of the Covenant): details still found throughout Traditional Lore and Holy Books. 
www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/chauvet/en/owpt14.htm 

*The Horse Cherub's front hoof (artfully tapered/pointed for emphasis) is shown symbolically striking a mountain- gushing forth a waterfall of Inspired Life/Being/Creation. 28,000 years later, the Bible's Book of Genesis records Adam being made from the earth's clay at basically the same time Pegasus of Greco-Roman Lore was credited with "using its front hooves to strike the ground of the earth and generate the Fountain of the Muses- Inspiring the root of all Creativity." (Origins and Consciousness, Erich Neumann) 
*The Creator's Steed multitasks- urinating a white cloud of (most certainly) holy, life sustaining water, while fertilizing and seeding the earth. These streams ("previously unexplained parallel lines under the horse") clearly point back to the Steed's most male parts! 
*This Inspired Parade of Creation continues with the Mammoth White Elephant- who symbolizes the Universal Monarch for Hindus/Buddhists. Incredibly- the Shaman drew a 'parade dress tassel' that springs forward from the high point of this Majestic Beast's front shoulders- indicating body adornment/jewelry, domestication and celebration! Very impressive. 
*Resembling the ancient Tarpan wild horse, this Angel of the Lord demonstrates effort and wide eyed determination- its head is lowered and wing(s) swept back. The thick mane crests and falls to the far side of the neck, allowing full view of that stylized wing. Known by many names: Magic Carpet; Tree of Life; Conductor of Souls; Emblem of Atlantis; Wheel; Throne; Unicorn; Christopher (Christ Bearer); Burak; Kalki; Odin's Steed; Paraclete; Guardian Angel- the Holy Books honor this Living Angelic Creature from Creation to the Story of Judgment Day! 
*A huge, snooted, earthbound pig/boar looks on facing/confronting this parade. The pig/boar has dual symbolism. This Adversary/Devil/Sloth of the Earth stands ready to tempt, but known in the Orient for luck, prosperity and fertility- it also welcomes/promotes life. Insightful! 
*God's Steed is the Creator's Holy Spirit in this Chauvet masterpiece. Located by design in the Hillaire Chamber- it intentionally overlooks the cave's sinkhole. The Shaman used this site's geography, contours, reliefs and spectacular abyss to 'stage' a most complete creation story. This cave's water path exit and darkness are symbolic of the River Styx and Hades/Hell. A vivid reminder of our future and most certainly used for ceremonial burial- explaining the complete absence of human bones. Wow! 
*The Angel of the Lord's presence at this original Story of Creation may help explain Genesis 1:26 from the Bible. "Let us make man in our own image after our likeness." Image/likeness here refers to spiritual being, not the temporary body. Angels indeed predate mankind, attending our Creation. The concepts of Angels; Trinity; The Creator's Holy Spirit and Judgment Day are also shared by the Holy Books! 
*The Angelic Horse/Holy Spirit is truly the Big Wheel, who at times travels in that form- do we see it here? That impressive quite round sinkhole is the ceremonial portal to and from the hidden Spiritual world. Jesus Christ went 'down' to Hades first after dying! The Angelic Horse with Its Wheel are now the first Religious Symbol followed by: the Circumpunct/Solar Cross (tie); Hindu Swastika; Tree of Life/Paisley and many Crosses. No lost symbol! 
*The Chauvet Grotto features a Noah's Ark variety of animals- appropriate for the Creation theme! Wooly Rhinoceros is the most numerous, but expected- as the single horn symbolizes eternal salvation by pointing the 'Way to Heaven'. Mentioned in the Bible, the legendary Unicorn was born right here, an inspired variation of God's Steed which honors The Creator. The Lone Centaur poses on a hanging rock- symbolizing ascension/enlightenment, the metaphysical unification of Soul and Spirit. Centaurs are present in all religions today. Inspired art of Divine Creation is on display at Chauvet. Enjoy! 
*Immense credit and thanks to the Inspired and very Holy Shaman Artist who pushed back our earliest known comprehensive narrative composition another 15,000 years! The Shaman's lucid Vision of Creation while in a psilocybin powered, entranced altered higher state of consciousness (ASC) apparently opened the Channel to Heaven's Mysteries and Universal Cognitive Truth. Clan members could now be shown the Story of Creation and answer to the age old question we all seem to ask- "Why are we here?" This is a cornerstone for subsequent Traditional Lore! Many Spiritual, Religious and Academic/Scientific (Johns Hopkins University 2006) use Magic Mushrooms to amplify their spirituality- i.e. Take the Magic Carpet Ride; Stairway to Heaven; Vision Quest; and the Ascension Dream, which Stars our heart based Guardian Angel- the Winged Horse. These hunter/gatherers prized the Fungus among us Mushrooms which were painted/recorded in other French cave art. Their incredible, edible value is reflected in Chauvet by the prominence given to their sources- Wooly Rhinoceros and Wooly Mammoth. Picture a warm, fresh cow pie giving off apparent steam on a frigid day- now envision mammoth Patties insulating/incubating the ice age mushrooms. Imagine the glee felt by the tribe members who simply harvested them, with one hand. Truffles from Snuffles!
God's Steed- Key to World Peace (C) 2011 Breese/DAoust is a unique non-fiction that cites Scripture, Lore, science, many witnesses and a plethora of cherubim graphics- all confirming the existence of this fine Angelic Beast. Horsefeathers? January 3, 1994: God's Steed visited Breese's living room, who detailed a report to the Church and they Knighted him. Chauvet-Pont-dArc was discovered December 18th, 1994. This Holy Site may help dawn the predicted Age of Aquarius.
