Another Labor Day and Little Reason for Worker Celebration (Joe Rothstein's Commentary)
August 29, 2011
By Joe Rothstein
Editor, EINNEWS.com

As we near another Labor Day, I'd like you to look at two scenarios and decide which one is closer to historic reality.

Scenario #1
Leaders of most U.S. businesses and industries got together many years ago to consider the plight of those who worked for them.  They concluded that most working people were not making enough money to compensate for their time and productivity, that most were working too many hours to have another life, and that working conditions were generally unsafe or downright hazardous.

And so, out of concern for the well-being of working people everywhere, employers decided to settle on a 40 hour work week, with overtime for more, to agree on reasonable standards of workplace safety, to refuse to hire children, and to establish systems of health and pension benefits to protect workers from financial calamity and old age poverty.

Scenario #2
Leaders of most U.S. businesses and industries vigorously fought every one of these worker benefits, and more, which were adopted only after years of street battles, legislative struggle and court challenges.

If you think that Scenario #1 is the way most Americans wound up with fair and reasonable working conditions, you need to back up and read your American labor history.

If you think that most U.S. business and industry leaders wouldn't like to turn back the clock, you need to catch up with today's news reports.

The fact is that generations of courageous workers are owed the credit for workers' rights that exist today, not generous employers.   In too many battles, courage was rewarded by broken heads and worse, courtesy of employer goon squads---in many cases backed up by police and National Guardsmen called out by governors and mayors who had their hands in the pockets of big financial interests.

You can name nearly any major industry---mining, transportation, food processing, wearing apparel and countless others---and you will find a history of bloody conflict, with workers fighting for honest compensation and reasonable working conditions and management wielding all the weapons money and influence can buy to try to stop them.

When we talk management-labor struggles we're not just talking history.  Management's weapons of choice no longer are stick-wielding thugs or guardsmen with bayonets.  If anything, their arsenal is a lot more potent than those in the past. 

Let's start with the obvious.  "Globalization" gives management labor that will work for 19th century level wages in China and southeast Asia, with little concern over bothersome health, safety and environmental regulations.  Wal-Mart has built America's dominant retail powerhouse by blackmailing its suppliers into moving U.S. jobs to China and elsewhere to produce in pre-New Deal conditions.

Even without moving operations offshore, American business benefits by the mere possibility. Exhibit A is the auto industry, where U.S. workers are being squeezed down from pay and benefit levels that once gave them income security and middle income purchasing power.

Rahm Emmanuel, President Obama's former chief of staff, said of the current recession that a crisis is too valuable to waste.  American business isn't wasting it.  In one of the more egregious examples, Dr. Pepper-Snapple, a very profitable company, last year forced its employees to take a major financial haircut just because high unemployment gave the company an opportunity to bring in hungry workers who would take those jobs at half the pay.

Less obvious is all of the political muscle big business is flexing through Congress, the administrative agencies and even the White House.  The U.S. Chamber has grown into a political goliath, just one of a number of vehicles business is using to weaken workers' rights and cripple the ability of unions to organize. 

By throwing sand in government gears through filibusters, legislative 'holds,' political intimidation and other means, mostly channeled through Republican proxies, business has all but neutered the National Labor Relations Board and is about to do the same to the agency that monitors worker health and safety.  Worker-friendly judge appointments are being frozen in limbo;  worker-friendly agency appointments are being scuttled.  

The White House has been so timid in the face of this onslaught that AFL-CIO Chief Richard Trumka announced the other day that unions no longer would be automatic contributors to Democratic Party candidates or help-mates for elections.

The evidence that the continuing assault on workers' rights, all workers' rights, not just organized labor's,  is stark and compelling.  If worker's gains had kept up with the nation's economic gains the past few decades the average worker would be making $90,000 today instead of $50,000. 

The huge increase in the nation's wealth during those years has mostly gone into a few pockets and hasn't been generally shared.

And consider this when you hear boasts of increasing business efficiency and worker productivity: That means fewer jobs. Business is getting more done with less.  Employees are required to work more hours and to produce more during the hours they work. Meanwhile, profits are up an average 22%.

A few issues ago, the magazine Mother Jones devoted itself to the productivity question. Its cover showed Lucy and Ethel in the iconic candy factory trying unsuccessfully to put chocolates into wrappers as the supervisor kept yelling to the conveyer belt operator "speed up."

Project that onto the larger employment stage and that's what we're seeing now.  Organized labor isn't in the streets trying to stop it.  The unions are mostly too weak to have much impact. The government agencies that are charged with protecting workers aren't stopping it, and neither is Congress.  Business is holding too many high cards to let them.  George Bush's White House was hostile to workers.  Barack Obama's has been friendly but mostly futile.

There have been many Labor Days where workers marched proudly.  This year it might be more appropriate to march carrying white handkerchiefs, not for surrender, but to dry tears.

Labor won the battle for workers' rights years ago.  But they didn't win the war.  The way things are going, they won't.
