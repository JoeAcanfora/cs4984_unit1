The Dominion of Canada Deploys OneShield Dragon(R) as Enterprise-Wide Policy Management Solution CIO Comments on Monumental Step to Optimize Partnerships With Independent Insurance Brokers, Maximize Efficiencies, Improve Data Capture and Deliver Meaningful Communication With Policyholders Delivered Both On-Time and On Budget

 OneShield, Inc., the developer of OneShield Dragon®, an innovative, modern, rules- and tools-based, data-driven policy management solution, is pleased to announce The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company (The Dominion) has deployed OneShield Dragon to support their goal of a single system for all personal and commercial lines of business. 
The Dominion's enterprise policy replacement project is an immense effort with multiple integration points resulting in ultimately retiring a number of legacy systems. This transformation will facilitate the ease of doing business for the independent broker distribution network by enabling straight through processing. The Dominion's commitment to operational excellence and being highly responsive to the changing needs of policyholders and the marketplace were critical factors that led the company to select OneShield for their core system modernization and platform consolidation initiative. 
"We realized from the outset the magnitude of effort involved in a core replacement project as well as the impact adapting to the change on our organization," said Janet Babcock, chief information officer for The Dominion. "It was imperative that we not only find the right technology -- but the right partner, so we could leverage that experience to our advantage. With OneShield, we found a partner with strong implementation experience and deep insurance knowledge. They worked collaboratively with us throughout our transition. We are very proud of what our team has accomplished. OneShield's commitment and partnership not only made getting to this point possible, but made the journey rewarding."
OneShield Dragon is a data-driven insurance underwriting, rating and workflow engine that efficiently manages policies across multiple lines of business. Based on proven insurance practices and a well-defined data model, OneShield Dragon provides configurable, modifiable options to meet today's goals and to adapt to future demands. 
"We are pleased to be a part of The Dominion's success in hitting this critical milestone," said Glenn Anschutz, president and CEO of OneShield, Inc. "We look forward to the continuing our partnership and supporting strategic growth for The Dominion today and in the future."
