It is generally considered the deadliest natural disaster ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted) and in China. The human deaths are estimated from 145,000, to between 3.7 million to 4 million.Weather historyFrom 1928 to 1930 a long drought preceded the flood. By some accounts abnormal weather over central China began in the winter of late 1930. Heavy snowstorms in the winter were followed by spring thaw/defrost heavy rains that raised the river levels even higher. The rain increased into July and August 1931. In July alone 7 cyclones hit the region. On average two occur per year.Death tolls and damages causedChinese sources usually indicate the death toll of the Yangtze River overflow at about 145,000 and affecting 28.5 million., while most western sources place the death toll from the floods at an estimation between 3.7 and 4 million people.Yellow RiverThe Yellow River has historically been considered the "Cradle of Chinese Civilization". Major floods in this river generally have catastrophic agricultural, economic and social impact. The Yellow River flood occurred between July and November 1931. Estimates of the number of people killed in the flood generally range from 1 to 2 million. Figures have shown about 1 million people died of drowning.SourceDescription above from the Wikipedia article 1931 China floods, licensed under CC-BY-SA full list of contributors here.
