Heavy rains and floods across China have killed 57 people and forced more than a million from their homes.Unprecedented rains over the past week swamped parts of northern, central and south-west China.Rivers are now rising although the rain has paused.The Ministry of Civil Affairs says the rain forced authorities to evacuate more than 1.2 million people from their homes.It says more than 120,000 houses have collapsed.$2.7 billion lossesEconomic losses from damaged houses, crops and land is estimated to have reached $US2.7 billion.Authorities have dispatched work teams to help with relief efforts, and plan to distribute thousands of tents, cots, blankets and clothing, the ministry said.One area of the south-western province of Sichuan, Bazhong, was severely affected, with 13 people left dead, 10 missing and 156 injured, a spokesman for the local government told the official China Daily newspaper.Over the weekend, officials in Sichuan's Dazhou and Guangan regions ordered the evacuation of over 600,000 people as major tributaries to the Yangtze - China's longest river - exceeded danger levels, the Xinhua news agency said.The Jialing river was recorded nearly seven metres above alert levels, and waters were expected to rise to their highest levels since record-keeping began in 1847, it added.China is hit by big downpours every summer. Last year saw the nation's worst flooding in a decade, leaving more than 4,300 people dead or missing.
