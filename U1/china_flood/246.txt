Heavy downpours cause severe flooding in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
              At least six people have been killed and thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes.
              The death toll could increase, as several people are still missing.
              With water levels still on the rise, local police and rescue teams have been dispatched to help trapped residents escape from homes and buildings.
              Shop owners have also moved their wares to higher ground.
              Floods triggered by heavy rains kill hundreds of people and force millions to evacuate each year during China's monsoon season.
