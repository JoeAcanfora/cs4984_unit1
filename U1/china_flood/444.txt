        /EINPresswire.com/Over 30,000 years ago, a spectacular Story of Creation was finger-puttied into the cave wall of Chauvet's Hillaire Chamber. 'Genesis of the World' appears to be a foundational cornerstone for subsequent Scripture. Indeed, religious symbolism dawned in southern France with this six meter mural. The star of this magical scene is a Winged Horse! A Universal Holy Being who symbolizes the spiritual bodies of both God and man. The first religious artifact (predating Noah's Ark and Ark of the Covenant): details still found throughout Traditional Lore and Holy Books…. <br />
www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/chauvet/en/owpt14.htm <br />
<br />
*The Horse Cherub's front hoof (artfully tapered/pointed for emphasis) is shown symbolically striking a mountain- gushing forth a waterfall of Inspired Life/Being/Creation. 28,000 years later, the Bible's Book of Genesis records Adam being made from the earth's clay at basically the same time Pegasus of Greco-Roman Lore was credited with "using its front hooves to strike the ground of the earth and generate the Fountain of the Muses- Inspiring the root of all Creativity." (Origins and Consciousness, Erich Neumann) <br />
*The Creator's Steed multitasks- urinating a white cloud of (most certainly) holy, life sustaining water, while fertilizing and seeding the earth. These streams ("previously unexplained parallel lines under the horse") clearly point back to the Steed's most male parts! <br />
*This Inspired Parade of Creation continues with the Mammoth White Elephant- who symbolizes the Universal Monarch for Hindus/Buddhists. Incredibly- the Shaman drew a 'parade dress tassel' that springs forward from the high point of this Majestic Beast's front shoulders- indicating body adornment/jewelry, domestication and celebration! Very impressive. <br />
*Resembling the ancient Tarpan wild horse, this Angel of the Lord demonstrates effort and wide eyed determination- its head is lowered and wing(s) swept back. The thick mane crests and falls to the far side of the neck, allowing full view of that stylized wing. Known by many names: Magic Carpet; Tree of Life; Conductor of Souls; Emblem of Atlantis; Wheel; Throne; Unicorn; Christopher (Christ Bearer); Burak; Kalki; Odin's Steed; Paraclete; Guardian Angel- the Holy Books honor this Living Angelic Creature from Creation to the Story of Judgment Day! <br />
*A huge, snooted, earthbound pig/boar looks on facing/confronting this parade. The pig/boar has dual symbolism. This Adversary/Devil/Sloth of the Earth stands ready to tempt, but known in the Orient for luck, prosperity and fertility- it also welcomes/promotes life. Insightful! <br />
*God's Steed is the Creator's Holy Spirit in this Chauvet masterpiece. Located by design in the Hillaire Chamber- it intentionally overlooks the cave's sinkhole. The Shaman used this site's geography, contours, reliefs and spectacular abyss to 'stage' a most complete creation story. This cave's water path exit and darkness are symbolic of the River Styx and Hades/Hell. A vivid reminder of our future and most certainly used for ceremonial burial- explaining the complete absence of human bones. Wow! <br />
*The Angel of the Lord's presence at this original Story of Creation may help explain Genesis 1:26 from the Bible. "Let us make man in our own image after our likeness." Image/likeness here refers to spiritual being, not the temporary body. Angels indeed predate mankind, attending our Creation. The concepts of Angels; Trinity; The Creator's Holy Spirit and Judgment Day are also shared by the Holy Books! <br />
*The Angelic Horse/Holy Spirit is truly the Big Wheel, who at times travels in that form- do we see it here? That impressive quite round sinkhole is the ceremonial portal to and from the hidden Spiritual world. Jesus Christ went 'down' to Hades first after dying! The Angelic Horse with Its Wheel are now the first Religious Symbol followed by: the Circumpunct/Solar Cross (tie); Hindu Swastika; Tree of Life/Paisley and many Crosses. No lost symbol! <br />
*The Chauvet Grotto features a Noah's Ark variety of animals- appropriate for the Creation theme! Wooly Rhinoceros is the most numerous, but expected- as the single horn symbolizes eternal salvation by pointing the 'Way to Heaven'. Mentioned in the Bible, the legendary Unicorn was born right here, an inspired variation of God's Steed which honors The Creator. The Lone Centaur poses on a hanging rock- symbolizing ascension/enlightenment, the metaphysical unification of Soul and Spirit. Centaurs are present in all religions today. Inspired art of Divine Creation is on display at Chauvet. Enjoy! <br />
*Immense credit and thanks to the Inspired and very Holy Shaman Artist who pushed back our earliest known comprehensive narrative composition another 15,000 years! The Shaman's lucid Vision of Creation while in a psilocybin powered, entranced altered higher state of consciousness (ASC) apparently opened the Channel to Heaven's Mysteries and Universal Cognitive Truth. Clan members could now be shown the Story of Creation and answer to the age old question we all seem to ask- "Why are we here?" This is a cornerstone for subsequent Traditional Lore! Many Spiritual, Religious and Academic/Scientific (Johns Hopkins University 2006) use Magic Mushrooms to amplify their spirituality- i.e. Take the Magic Carpet Ride; Stairway to Heaven; Vision Quest; and the Ascension Dream, which Stars our heart based Guardian Angel- the Winged Horse. These hunter/gatherers prized the Fungus among us Mushrooms which were painted/recorded in other French cave art. Their incredible, edible value is reflected in Chauvet by the prominence given to their sources- Wooly Rhinoceros and Wooly Mammoth. Picture a warm, fresh cow pie giving off apparent steam on a frigid day- now envision mammoth Patties insulating/incubating the ice age mushrooms. Imagine the glee felt by the tribe members who simply harvested them, with one hand. Truffles from Snuffles!<br />
God's Steed- Key to World Peace (C) 2011 Breese/D′Aoust is a unique non-fiction that cites Scripture, Lore, science, many witnesses and a plethora of cherubim graphics- all confirming the existence of this fine Angelic Beast. Horsefeathers? January 3, 1994: God's Steed visited Breese's living room, who detailed a report to the Church and they Knighted him. Chauvet-Pont-d′Arc was discovered December 18th, 1994. This Holy Site may help dawn the predicted Age of Aquarius. <br />

<p>
  Ruby Creek Resources, Inc. (OTCBB: RBYC), a gold exploration and mining company with operations in Tanzania, is pleased to announce Mr. Jan Serfontein has joined Ruby Creek as Chief Geologist.</p>
        <p>For over two decades Mr. Serfontein has explored for a wide range of precious and base metals in many African countries. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology and Honors Bachelor of Science degree in Exploration Geology from the University of Pretoria. Following work at the Geological Survey of South Africa, Rocklabs, South African Development Trust Corporation, Jan co-founded VSA Earth Science Consultants, which rendered a specialized service in selected Earth Science disciplines. In 1997 he initiated the incorporation of VSA GeoConsultants, Caser Construction, VSA Uganda and VSA Tanzania into Set Point Technology Holdings, a Johannesburg Stock Exchange listed company, where Jan assumed the role of Divisional Director. Following a successful management buy-out of the entire VSA Division in July 2000, the VSA GeoConsultants Group was established, of which he was the Chief Executive Officer until 2008, when the Company merged with a Canadian major (Golder). During this time his appointments included Country Manager (Geology and Mining) Uganda, Tanzania, Sierra Leone and Angola for Canadian and British companies, Diamond Works and Branch Energy (in both hard rock and alluvial settings).</p>
        <p>Jan co-founded the platinum exploration company Blue Sky Exploration, which successfully reverse listed on the London Alternative Exchange as Cluff Platinum. His work at Blue Sky resulted in the discovery of the Blue Ridge platinum mine (<a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=801595&amp;id=780223&amp;type=1&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.aquariusplatinum.com%2f">http://www.aquariusplatinum.com</a>). He co-founded UIS Analytical Services, arguably one of the largest privately owned analytical laboratories in Africa.</p>
        <p>Beginning in early October, Jan is leading the exploration of the entire Gold Plateau area. Additionally a production exploration program will be started on the areas of Ruby Creek's planned mining licenses. The initial goal of the program is to explore and prove up a reportable 200,000 inferred ounces of gold. Additionally the geological team will map the area's high grade zones, often found in placer deposits, to guide production of those zones. Followed by a full-scale Project program delineating potential reserves while looking for possible source rock for hard rock drill targets. Jan is working with the technical team in designing and equipping the onsite laboratory located at the Gold Plateau Camp, for quickly processing ore samples for internal evaluation. He will also be identifying other experienced technical talent to join the geology team.</p>
        <p>Robert Slavik, President and CEO of Ruby Creek, said, "We have extensively searched the mining space for geologists with strong capabilities and experiences to lead both placer and hard rock exploration. Jan has great experience in a wide range of deposit types. He was recently onsite at the Gold Plateau and was quite impressed with our Project both in its large expanse of gold showings on the property with the possibility of identifying and discovering multiple source hard rock targets. Looking at Jan's experience and accomplishments, I am very pleased to announce that he has joined our team as our full time Chief Geologist. We are all looking forward to his leadership in the exploration and development of our Gold Plateau Project."</p>

        <h2>TiVo iPad and iPhone Apps to Add Deeper Facebook Integration Layering Friends' Recommendations and Real-Time Viewing Activity Over TiVo's Smart Search, Browse and Suggestion Features</h2><div style="float:left;"><a href="http://www.tivo.com"><img src="http://media.marketwire.com/attachments/201001/555849_TiVoLogo.JPG"></a></div><br clear="left">







<p>
 <a href="http://www.tivo.com/">TiVo Inc.</a> (NASDAQ: TIVO), the creator of and leader in advanced television services including digital video recorders (DVRs), announced in conjunction with f8, Facebook's developer conference, that it will update its popular iPhone and iPad apps to include additional integration with Facebook to increase Social TV functionality. Facebook's newly announced Like and Watch integrations with the enhanced Facebook APIs which will allow people who use the TiVo service to further connect with family, friends, and subscribers around the entertainment they love to offer an added layer of recommendations further enabling TiVo lovers to enjoy brilliant TV from the world's only smart DVR.</p>
        <p>The improved Facebook integration creates a social guide for people to expand their typical entertainment choices by discovering new programs through the recommendations of their Facebook friends. TiVo users will be able to discover programs their Facebook friends endorse with the Like feature, or view what shows their friends are currently enjoying with the Watch feature and immediately schedule a recording or watch live based on those recommendations. And because the TiVo iPad and iPhone apps are linked to the TiVo DVR, TiVo users can feature the program they're watching to their friends and subscribers on Facebook with a flick of their finger.</p>
        <p>"When we launched the TiVo apps for iPhone and iPad earlier this year, we did so with the goal of expanding the ways TiVo lovers can interact with people, the web, and the entertainment they're viewing while they watch TV. With this improved Facebook integration, TiVo users can discover things to watch from the new social guide, and can feature their entertainment experiences and choices with their friends," said Jim Denney, Vice President and General Manager of product marketing for TiVo Inc. "Through full integration with the set-top box, TiVo is defining the future of Social TV by offering a new way for people to connect and interact on the second screen in a way that is fully integrated with their actual TV watching experience."</p>
        <p>The TiVo App retains its unique and easy-to-use interface and lets people peruse TiVo's hallmark search, browse and recommendation functions, without disrupting what they are watching on the big screen. As people connect and interact with the Social TV features on the TiVo app, they will have more robust access to suggested programming provided by their networks on Facebook. </p>
        <p>The improved integrations will launch on the TiVo app later this year. The TiVo App is available for free from the App Store on iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, or at <a href="http://www.itunes.com/appstore">www.itunes.com/appstore</a>. </p>
        <p>The TiVo App for iPhone supports all high definition TiVo DVRs, including TiVo Premiere, Premiere XL, Series3&#8482;, HD and HD XL.* Series2 and non-TiVo users can still sample the TiVo experience through the apps Guest Mode. Users can browse, search and scroll through program and channel guides and experience the simplicity of the TiVo interface. A valid TiVo user account is required for full functionality.</p>
        <p>For more information on the TiVo app please visit <a href="http://www.tivo.com/ipad">www.tivo.com/ipad</a>. </p>
        <p>*TiVo Series3&#8482;, HD and HD XL DVR users will enjoy the app's guide, scheduling, remote control, search and explore features, but these users should anticipate a smaller set of features and capabilities than TiVo Premiere users. </p>

        <p>Core News Facts:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>Today at f8, Facebook's developer conference, Ticketfly announced a new Facebook integration that allows ticket buyers to share the artists they are excited to see at upcoming music events with their friends.
            </li>
<li>Beyond letting your friends know what you like, Ticketfly now helps fans discover what events their friends are actually going to see.
            </li>
<li>How it works: following a ticket purchase, ticket buyers see an overlay or "light box" on their purchase confirmation page which allows them to share with their friends in three important ways. In one click, ticket buyers can: (1) create a personalized News Feed story and "like" artists, (2) RSVP to the event, and (3) invite friends to purchase tickets to the same event.
            </li>
<li>Facebook has always made it easy to discover great things through your friends; now Ticketfly, with this new Facebook integration, makes it even easier to discover more music artists and events with your friends.
            </li>
<li>As one of the developers included in the f8 announcements, Ticketfly is leading the way in making the live music and ticketing industries more social. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Music promoters are always excited when we deliver a new Facebook feature. This latest integration is particularly powerful because it sits directly inside the ticket purchase process and gives fans an easy way to connect around live music and discover new artists," said Dan Teree, President &amp; COO of Ticketfly. "Tapping the Facebook social graph improves the experience for ticket buyers, our clients and artists and is core to Ticketfly's mission of making it easy for friends to see amazing music together."</p>
        <p>Through Facebook Platform, people can share the experience of seeing musical artists with their friends, making their online experience more personal and relevant.</p>
        <p>Please visit: <a href="http://www.ticketfly.com/blog">www.ticketfly.com/blog</a> to learn more about Ticketfly's integration with Facebook.</p>

        <h2>Anti-Aging Advocate Reveals Why Plastic Surgery Can Be Good for You</h2><div style="float:left;"><a href="http://foreverkindayoung.blogspot.com"><img src="http://media.marketwire.com/attachments/201109/24524_Baskin.jpeg"></a></div><br clear="left">



<p>
 Jane Baskin thinks that if you don't like what you see in the mirror, you should feel free to change it.</p>
        <p>"I'm a big advocate of what I call Life 2.0," said Baskin, a former social worker, anti-aging advocate and author of "Jane of the Jungle" (<a href="http://foreverkindayoung.blogspot.com/">http://foreverkindayoung.blogspot.com</a>). "What I'm referring to is the third stage of life, or the second stage of middle age. Because of the extended life span and the ability to prolong youth with medicine, diet, exercise and plastic surgery, old age is postponed. So what do you do when your kids are grown and you don't want to work a straight job anymore? Waiting to die used to be a brief wait, but now it can take thirty years or more. Life 2.0 is that time between cresting middle age and getting old. It should be as vital a time as youth. And if you feel young, you should look young, too."</p>
        <p>The numbers bear her out. According to statistics released today by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), 13.1 million cosmetic plastic surgery procedures, including those that are minimally-invasive or surgical, were performed in the United States in 2010, up 5 percent from 2009. In addition, more than 5.3 million reconstructive plastic surgery procedures were performed last year, up 2 percent. </p>
        <p>The top five surgical procedures in 2010 were:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>Breast augmentation (296,000)
            </li>
<li>Nose reshaping (252,000)
            </li>
<li>Eyelid surgery (209,000)
            </li>
<li>Liposuction (203,000)
            </li>
<li>Tummy tuck (116,000)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Our life spans have increased dramatically over the last few decades, but the real question is whether we are truly living with those extra years," she added. "Eating healthy and exercising can keep us going on the inside, so what's wrong with making use of the medical technology available to make the outside match the inside? There is a vast gulf between feeling good and feeling good about ourselves, and that's where cosmetic surgery can help us fill in the gaps. Why not stay fit and look as young as you feel? We're going to live a long time. Why live it badly?"</p>

      <p>
        <em style="font-weight: bold;"></em> Grizzly Discoveries Inc. (TSX VENTURE:GZD) (OTCQX:GZDIF) (FRANKFURT:G6H) ("Grizzly" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that Lone Peak Drilling of Kimberley, British Columbia, will shortly commence drilling on the Company's 100% owned Greenwood Gold Project, a 225,000 acre contiguous block of mineral claims centered on Greenwood, British Columbia. The Company commenced ground exploration in early May. Drill permits were recently received from the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines for the Ket 28, Dayton and Motherlode target areas; a 4,000 to 5,000 m surface diamond drilling program on these and a number of new target areas is planned. Lone Peak Drilling has initiated equipment mobilization with the intent to commence drilling late this week or early next week.</p>
      <p>
        <em style="font-weight: bold;">Current Exploration Status</em>
      </p>
      <p>The Stage 1 field-based exploration program which began in May 2011 continues. The program consists of extensive ground geophysical surveys including: induced polarization ("IP") surveys; horizontal loop electromagnetic ("HLEM") surveys; Promis electromagnetic ("EM") surveys; magnetometer surveys; prospecting; rock and soil sampling. This work is coupled with geological mapping at existing targets including: Copper Mountain, Ket 28, and the Dayton area as well as new targets identified by detailed analysis of airborne geophysical surveys conducted in 2008 and 2009. To date, approximately 6,700 soil samples and 394 rock grab samples have been collected and shipped to ALS Chemex in Vancouver, British Columbia. More than 94 line-km of IP surveys (at 9 targets), more than 75 line-km of ground HLEM and Promis EM surveys, and more than 105 line-km of ground magnetic surveys have also been completed. </p>
      <p>
        <em style="font-weight: bold;">New Targets for Follow-up Exploration</em>
      </p>
      <p>The 2011 fieldwork has identified coincident IP or HLEM anomalies with spatially associated gold in soil anomalies of greater than 100 parts per billion (ppb) gold at the Copper Mountain, Overlander, P2, P4, P5 and B4-B5 target areas. Additional gold in soil anomalies have been identified in conjunction with IP anomalies at previously drilled targets including Ket 28, Dayton and the Motherlode areas. Anomalous rock grab sample with greater than 5 grams per tonne (g/t) gold or greater than 1% copper, in most cases, are spatially coincident with magnetic or EM anomalies that have been identified at the Overlander, Motherlode, P5, B7, Ket 28, Dayton and the Copper Mountain target areas. A number of the gold in soil anomalies and anomalous rock grab samples that are spatially associated with geophysical anomalies, including HLEM and IP anomalies are targets to be drill tested during this program. A number of the anomalies are also coincident with historic workings that have, to the Company's knowledge, never been drilled. </p>
      <p>
        <em style="font-weight: bold;">Future Work</em>
      </p>
      <p>Additional land use applications for drilling have been submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Mines in Cranbrook, British Columbia and are being processed for approval for the Copper Mountain and Overlander target areas. Drilling applications are in progress for the P2, P4, P5 and B4-B5 target areas. Drilling will commence shortly and continue through to the end of November, 2011. Grizzly has planned a minimum budget of approximately $1.2 million for 4,000 to 5,000 metres of diamond drilling on the Greenwood Gold Project in 2011. </p>
      <p>All 2011 field and office exploration programs are conducted under the supervision of Mr. Michael Dufresne, M.Sc., P.Geol., a principal of APEX Geoscience Ltd. and a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101.</p>
