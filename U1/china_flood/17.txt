Ping pong is more than a sport in China – it’s simply a part of daily life. The national sport of 1.3 billion people, it’s beloved by everyone from kindergartners to grandmothers. The game’s important cultural role is evident just by looking around China’s cities, with ping pong tables claiming a prime spot in parks, apartment compounds and even along busy streets. Though much of China is still poor, nearly everyone has the means to play ping pong. All that’s needed is a table, two paddles and a ball. Photos by Oded Balilty/Associated Press
