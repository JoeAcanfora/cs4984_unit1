              The autumnal equinox will occur at 5:04
a.m EDT, Friday, Sept. 23. This marks
the point at which the sun's rays are
directed over the equator, causing days
and nights to be of equal duration. The
word "equinox" comes from the latin
meaning "equal nights." This marks the
beginning of autumn in the Northern
Hemisphere and spring in the Southern
Hemisphere.
