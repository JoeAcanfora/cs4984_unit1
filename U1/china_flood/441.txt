TiVo(R) Integrates With Facebook(R) Platform to Define the Future of Social TV TiVo iPad and iPhone Apps to Add Deeper Facebook Integration Layering Friends' Recommendations and Real-Time Viewing Activity Over TiVo's Smart Search, Browse and Suggestion Features

TiVo Inc. (NASDAQ: TIVO), the creator of and leader in advanced television services including digital video recorders (DVRs), announced in conjunction with f8, Facebook's developer conference, that it will update its popular iPhone and iPad apps to include additional integration with Facebook to increase Social TV functionality. Facebook's newly announced Like and Watch integrations with the enhanced Facebook APIs which will allow people who use the TiVo service to further connect with family, friends, and subscribers around the entertainment they love to offer an added layer of recommendations further enabling TiVo lovers to enjoy brilliant TV from the world's only smart DVR.
The improved Facebook integration creates a social guide for people to expand their typical entertainment choices by discovering new programs through the recommendations of their Facebook friends. TiVo users will be able to discover programs their Facebook friends endorse with the Like feature, or view what shows their friends are currently enjoying with the Watch feature and immediately schedule a recording or watch live based on those recommendations. And because the TiVo iPad and iPhone apps are linked to the TiVo DVR, TiVo users can feature the program they're watching to their friends and subscribers on Facebook with a flick of their finger.
"When we launched the TiVo apps for iPhone and iPad earlier this year, we did so with the goal of expanding the ways TiVo lovers can interact with people, the web, and the entertainment they're viewing while they watch TV. With this improved Facebook integration, TiVo users can discover things to watch from the new social guide, and can feature their entertainment experiences and choices with their friends," said Jim Denney, Vice President and General Manager of product marketing for TiVo Inc. "Through full integration with the set-top box, TiVo is defining the future of Social TV by offering a new way for people to connect and interact on the second screen in a way that is fully integrated with their actual TV watching experience."
The TiVo App retains its unique and easy-to-use interface and lets people peruse TiVo's hallmark search, browse and recommendation functions, without disrupting what they are watching on the big screen. As people connect and interact with the Social TV features on the TiVo app, they will have more robust access to suggested programming provided by their networks on Facebook. 
The improved integrations will launch on the TiVo app later this year. The TiVo App is available for free from the App Store on iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, or at www.itunes.com/appstore. 
The TiVo App for iPhone supports all high definition TiVo DVRs, including TiVo Premiere, Premiere XL, Series3, HD and HD XL.* Series2 and non-TiVo users can still sample the TiVo experience through the apps Guest Mode. Users can browse, search and scroll through program and channel guides and experience the simplicity of the TiVo interface. A valid TiVo user account is required for full functionality.
For more information on the TiVo app please visit www.tivo.com/ipad. 
*TiVo Series3, HD and HD XL DVR users will enjoy the app's guide, scheduling, remote control, search and explore features, but these users should anticipate a smaller set of features and capabilities than TiVo Premiere users.
