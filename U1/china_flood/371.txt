80 Armed Police Officers Killed by Mountain Torrent in Fujian




 





The death toll caused by mountain torrents that hit an armed police unit in east China's Fujian Province Sunday night rose to 80 on Friday, rescuers said. 
Among the 57 people saved, 39 were wounded and hospitalized. Some of them have recovered. Rescuers are still searching for the 5 people who remain missing, the sources said. Servicemen, policemen and local residents have been engaged in the rescue work over the past five days and have recovered 80 bodies. 
The sudden downpour brought by Typhoon Longwang hit the unit stationed in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province, Sunday night, when mountain torrents dashed against two houses and washed away people inside. 
The reason for the disaster is under investigation, the sources said.
