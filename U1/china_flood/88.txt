Founded on March 10th 1904, the RCSC has been involved in assisting wounded soldier, helping the refugees in times of conflict and providing assistance to disaster victims. The RCSC aslso supports whenever possible relief activities in other countries and regions. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, with the support of the Central Government , the RCSC was reorganized in August, 1950 and reclaimed its legal membership in the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The RCSC has been contributing a lot to assisting the Government in implementing the Geneva Conventions, supporting the state development and improving the people's health. In 1993, the Standing Committee of National People's Congress officially promulgated the Red Cross Law of the People's Republic of China, which provides legal protection to the Chinese Red Cross and its work. The Red Cross of Hong Kong and Macau became highly autonomous branches of the RCSC in 1997 and 1999 respectively. Since China started its reforms and opening up policies in 1978, the RCSC has moved into a continuous and rapid development phase.

At the end of 1997, the Standing Committee of the China's National People's Conference which ensures the status and role of the RCSC in the blood donation program, and also symbolized the beginning of the non-remunerated blood donation system in China. The Red Cross Society of China has always been maintaining a good cooperative relationship with the International Committee of Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and many other national societies. It also actively supports other sister national RC societies. From 1985, the RCSC was elected for two terms as a member of the Federation Governing Board and once as Vice President. The RCSC 7th National Convention in 1999 was a very important conference in the RCSC history. State President Jiang Zemin was invited again to serve as the Honorary President of the Society, and Mmd. Peng Peiyun, the Vice Chair person of the Standing Committee of National People's Congress was elected as the President of the RCS. The 7th Convention also adopted the Strategy Work Plan 2000 - 2004 of the Red Cross Society of China. In the new century, the RCSC will further the dissemination, advocacy and implementation of the Red Cross Law of the People's Republic of China. The National Society will focus on the four major tasks of disaster response and preparedness, first aid training, community service and the dissemination of the International Humanitarian Law and RC Movement knowledge, In addition it will strengthen three strategic directions of human resources development, information and advocacy, fund-raising and income generation, In co-ordination with the social spiritual civilization building and social security system, the RCSC has developed disster relief, healthe care and community service projects, to build up a Red Cross course with Chinese characteristics.
