UK Government's Wind Farm Plans Are 'Big Gamble' and the Numbers Do Not Add Up, Say MPs...The Government's wind farm plans are a 'big gamble' which may not pay off, according to a committee of British MPs.

They say ministers are banking on the cost of offshore wind going down and major improvements in efficiency to 'make the numbers add up'.

In a report, they say a 'supergrid' - costing up to GBP60 billion - may be needed to join Britain's  wind farms to plants in other  European countries. (dailymail.co.uk)
