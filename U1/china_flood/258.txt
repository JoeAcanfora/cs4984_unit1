				MORE than a million people in China have been evacuated following downpours that have raised water levels in rivers to critical highs, and triggered floods and landslides, the government has said.
				



The summer rains have left at least 168 people dead or missing  so far, and weather authorities warned today that flood-hit  areas across the southern half of China would experience a fresh  round of heavy rainfall."These areas must strengthen their prevention of geological  disasters," the National Meteorological Centre said.Authorities have evacuated more than a million people in eight  provinces, regions and municipalities since June 9, the civil  affairs ministry said late on Thursday.One waterway in the eastern province of Zhejiang has risen to  its highest levels in 56 years, while other rivers across southern  China have burst their banks, the nation's flood control  headquarters added.

Some of the areas being pounded by rain, such as Hubei and Hunan  provinces, were only recently in the thrall of a severe drought,  which has in some cases made the situation worse.A week ago, a landslide blasted through villages in Hunan before  dawn, killing at least 19 people and leaving another eight missing.  One village saw most of its houses buried by mud, state media  reported.Experts sent to investigate said the mudslide was triggered by  the heaviest rain in the area in 300 years, adding the ground was  drier than usual because of the drought, making it easier for  downpours to sweep away sand and rocks.China is hit by heavy summer rainfalls every year. In 2010,  torrential downpours across large swaths of the country triggered  the nation's worst floods in a decade, leaving more than 4300  people dead or missing.A devastating mudslide in the northwestern province of Gansu  killed 1500 people in August.
