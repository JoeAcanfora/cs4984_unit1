            According to a report from researcher Gartner, tablet sales are expected to surge this year, with Apple’s <a href="http://www.pixeltrack66.com/mt/w274339464z203u274/" style="color:#006600;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;background:none;padding:0;margin:0;">iPad</a> still ruling the market with an iron fist.
Gartner forecasts this year’s global tablet sales to reach 63.6 million units, which is a 264 percent jump compared to last year.
Apple’s hold on the market is firm, as the <a href="http://www.pixeltrack66.com/mt/w274339464z203u274/" style="color:#006600;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;background:none;padding:0;margin:0;">iPad</a> is expected to account for 73 percent of the tablets sold this year, selling 46.7 million tablets.
Carolina Milanesi… Gartner’s research vice president said in a statement, “Apple delivers a superior and unified user experience across its hardware, software and services. Unless competitors can respond with a similar approach, challenges to Apple’s position will be minimal.”
Don’t count Android tablets out, though… Android is forecast to cut into <a href="http://www.pixeltrack66.com/mt/w274339464z203u274/" style="color:#006600;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;background:none;padding:0;margin:0;">iPad</a>’s market share over the next few years.
Gartner believes tablet sales will hit 326.3 million units by 2015, with only 45% of those predicted to be credited to the <a href="http://www.pixeltrack66.com/mt/w274339464z203u274/" style="color:#006600;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;background:none;padding:0;margin:0;">iPad</a>.
As of right now, Android run tablets are expected to represent 17 percent of sales, a 3 percent jump up from last year. 
Other platforms can expect some success as well. Microsoft is expected to sell about 4.3 million tablets next year, growing to 34.4 million in 2015.
Up until now Microsoft has been non-existent on the tablet market, but with Windows 8, Microsoft might just change their luck.
