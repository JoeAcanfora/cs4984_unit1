Disaster-relief Work Underway in Liaoning




 





Emergency disaster relief work is underway in northeast China's Liaoning Province after massive flooding. 
The provincial government has allocated 4.5 million yuan (about US$555,000) for emergency disaster relief. 
The department of civil affairs relocated 190,000 homeless people and workers are now in the region to organize the disaster relief work. 
Zhou Zhimin is the deputy head of the department. 
"After the flood recedes, we will focus on house construction. We will try our best to ensure afflicted people can live in new houses by the beginning of winter." 
Torrential rainstorms and floods in the province since Friday killed ten people, injured 46 and left 35 others missing. The floods hit 20 counties of seven cities in Liaoning, affecting 1.4 million people. More than 65,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 120,000 hectares of farmland are damaged.
