China Hits Out at U.S. Deal on Taiwan F-16 Fighters...China has reacted angrily to a U.S. deal to upgrade Taiwan's ageing fleet of U.S.-built F-16 fighter planes. Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun said the $5.85 billion deal would "inevitably undermine bilateral relations", including military and security co-operation. He also summoned U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke to protest against the deal. China traditionally reacts strongly to U.S. military co-operation with Taiwan, which it considers its territory.  (bbc.co.uk)
