Kevin McDonald: What I Love Most About Canada

Comedian, actor, writer, director and co-founder of “The Kids in the Hall”
What I love most about Canada and being a Canadian is that I'm always asked what I love most about being a Canadian. I honestly believe that Canada is the only country in the world that sits around and asks that question. I refuse to believe that Argentines sit around asking each other what they love about Argentina.  If countries were comedians, the U.S. would be Andrew Dice Clay and Canada would be Woody Allen. Yes. I see Canada as a short, balding man with thick glasses who stutters when talking to a girl. We Canadians think and worry too much -- and thus we think and worry too much about ourselves.

The Execution of Troy Davis Was a Miscarriage of Justice and the World Watched It Play Out



Rev. Al Sharpton, 9/22/11
President, National Action Network
As I left Georgia yesterday for NY, I was consumed with irony. So many heads of state were gathered at the UN hearing the U.S. stress the importance of human rights as we simultaneously executed this man.

Troy Davis Is Dead; the Movement Continues



Rashad Robinson, 9/22/11
Executive Director, ColorOfChange
Before he died, Troy told us that this was about more than him -- and he called on those of us who have fought against his execution to continue fighting for justice, even if we weren't successful in saving his life.

Is the Business Conference Dead?



Dan Jacob, 9/22/11
TEDxToronto Co-Chair
The word "conference" has developed bit of a bad reputation as of late. CEOs and community organizers have begun to think of the word "conference" as being synonymous with "boring," "tedious" or "unoriginal." And they're right.

Dan Rather, 9/22/11
Host, 'Dan Rather Reports'
Why should we care about the plight of honeybees? Because the entire food chain is at risk. One in three bites of food we eat is directly dependent on insect pollination.

Our Heroes Are M.I.A. During Financial Crisis



Andrew Cooper, 9/22/11
CIGI Distinguished Fellow and BSIA Professor
As the global economy continues to struggle, the image of heroic leadership has waned. President Obama falls into this category, exhorting Americans to buy his economic agenda but running into the obstacles presented by Congress and a cynical and deeply divided public.

Obama Tells Palestinians to Stay in Back of the Bus



Steve Clemons, 9/22/11
Publisher, 'The Washington Note'
President Obama's speech at the United Nations yesterday paled in comparison to the soaring, expectation raising addresses he gave early in his administration, particularly in Cairo, but also at past UN General Assembly gatherings. The President has lost his groove.

The Spark Is Gone



Kristina Groves, 9/22/11
Four-time Olympic speed skating medalist
Continuing to compete wouldn't be fair to those who support me or to my coaches and teammates or, most importantly, to myself. It took a healthy dose of brutal honesty for me to admit that no matter how I slice it, I always come back to the same thing: it is quite simply, sadly, happily, the end.

Blessed are the Businessmen and Women



Stanley Weiss, 9/22/11
Founding Chairman, Business Executives for National Security
Maybe if the benefits of peace in the Middle East were made material and not ethereal, with concrete commitments rather than vague promises, it would be the kind of disruptive development that sparks compromise.

5 Things Men Look for in Women



Nicole Forrester, 9/22/11
Olympian High Jumper, Commonwealth Games Gold Medalist, Sports Psychology Consultant
Sorry ladies, apparently attributing your mood to hormones is not acceptable. Surprisingly, men do not enjoy women who may, from time to time, appear like Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest.

Ahmadinejad Is the Real Threat



Menachem Rosensaft, 9/22/11
Founding Chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors
It would be foolish in the extreme for any of us to lose sight of the fact that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's continued saber-rattling constitutes a far greater time-bomb than anything that PA President Mahmoud Abbas or any other Palestinian leader says or does.

We Are All Eyewitnesses



Mary Mapes, 9/21/11
Veteran TV reporter, on the team that broke the Abu Ghraib scandal
Our system, too often, is as fundamentally unfair as we are -- as cruel as any one person can be, as riddled with hypocrisy, confusion and mistakes. Tonight, as prayers are delivered and hopes are dashed, we should resolve to finally do something about our addiction to execution.

Healthy Eating in High-End Restaurants: "Haute Cuisine" Needs an Overhaul



Mahalia Freed, ND, 9/21/11
Naturopathic Doctor, BodyTalk Practitioner, Writer, Speaker, Educator, Kale Crusader
Too often, a restaurant's inflated price point leaves me flat when measured against the profoundly uninspiring vegetable accompaniment that has been prepared with all the verve and creativity of a dial tone. I'm sorry, but steamed carrots and a slice of wobbly bell pepper just doesn't feel good in my body.

Wind Turbines Blow Off Freedom of Speech



John Laforet, 9/21/11
President, Wind Concerns Ontario
Recently, a family in Thamesville began suffering adverse health effects commonly reported by individuals living near industrial wind developments. Could they have avoided this based on the past experiences of others had former residents not been 'prohibited by agreement' from answering questions about their health?

Founder of "Finding the Pieces", Speaker, and Teacher
As a native of Georgia, Decatur to be specific, I mourn for us. We've taken some steps back in our progression; there's a silent, suffocating fear that is hovering over our state.

Protect Canada's Forests -- Only Half of Them Are Intact



David Suzuki, 9/22/11
Co-founder, the David Suzuki Foundation
Although advances in modern agriculture have brought millions of hectares of once-unsuitable scrub land into food production, the environmental consequences of our growing "foodprint" have been severe.

Portrait of the (f)Artist as a Young Man



Kevin Smith, 9/22/11
That fat guy who got thrown off the plane.
My most cherished responsibility as a bona fide indie filmmaker is to let everyone know the shot is always worth taking. It costs nothing to encourage an artist, and the potential return is immeasurable. A song will cheer your mood. A movie will let you escape. A podcast will make you laugh. Nice dividends to a simple investment.
