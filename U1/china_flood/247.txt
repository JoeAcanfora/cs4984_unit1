The death toll from severe flooding in China has risen to at least 90 people following a week of heavy rain.
Another 22 were missing as of Wednesday following the torrential rain, flooding and landslides that have pounded the regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Chongqing, Hubei, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu and Qinghai, according to Xinhua News.
Weather observations show that, since Tuesday, light rain has continued to fall, although even this faded away on Wednesday. The end of soaking rain has allowed floodwaters on swollen rivers to crest and recede as of Wednesday. Meteorologists at AccuWeather.com foresee intermittent light rain, but no return of heavy rain through at least the start of next week, so high waters should continue to lower. 
At one time, more than 1.2 million people had been evacuated from their homes, owing to the flooding, according to multiple reports on line. Wednesday, Xinhua put the figure at 1.39 million in only one province, Sichuan. 
In hard-hit Sichuan alone, at least 19 people died and another 16 were missing as of Wednesday, Xinhua News said. Its report also spoke of 40,000 houses destroyed in the province. The flooding and heavy rain also affected more than 16,700 hectares (more than 41,000 acres) of crops. Province-wide, economic losses were pegged at 10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion U.S.) since Sept. 16. 
In Shaanxi, a landslide last Saturday buried a brick works at Baquio, killing 19 people, Xinhua reported on Tuesday. Another 13 were still missing. 
Earlier, in the Sichuan cities of Bazhong, Dazhou and Guang'an alone, 1.06 million people were evacuated ahead of what Xinhua said was expected to be "the worst flooding since records began in 1847."
Floodwaters on the Jialing River, which empties into the mighty Yangtze at Chongqing, crested early in the day on Wednesday, according to Xinhua. 
One area upstream, the Jialing, had been forecast to crest at the highest levels since record-keeping began in 1847, The Australian said on Tuesday.

              The autumnal equinox will occur at 5:04
a.m EDT, Friday, Sept. 23. This marks
the point at which the sun's rays are
directed over the equator, causing days
and nights to be of equal duration. The
word "equinox" comes from the latin
meaning "equal nights." This marks the
beginning of autumn in the Northern
Hemisphere and spring in the Southern
Hemisphere.
