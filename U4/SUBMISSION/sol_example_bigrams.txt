BP also inserted plugs on the top and sides of the container, which had been lowered over a leaking drill pipe in an effort to funnel oil to the surface.\nBP and the Coast Guard both say no oil has been seen leaking out of the container since it was capped and plugged.

Five wind projects totaling 300 megawatts (MW) and 18 solar projects for 133 MW were added, according to the latest \"Energy Infrastructure Update\" from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Office of Energy Projects.\nAnd renewables account for almost half (43.8%) of all new capacity that's come online this year so far: 77 wind projects (4,055 MW); 154 solar projects (936 MW); 76 biomass projects (340 MW); 7 geothermal projects (123 MW); 10 water power projects (9 MW); and 1 waste heat project (3 MW).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead original story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinter-friendly version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Scientist Michael Mann Sues National Review for Libel  \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOct 23, 2012\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    (The Daily Climate)        \n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Mann, an influential climatologist who has spent years in the center of the debate over climate science, has sued two organizations that have accused him of academic fraud and of improperly manipulating data.\nMann, director of Pennsylvania State University's Earth System Science Center, on Monday sued the National Review and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, along with two of their authors, Rand Simberg and Mark Steyn. \nThe lawsuit, Mann's lawyer said in a statement, was based upon their \"false and defamatory statements\" accusing him of academic fraud and comparing him to a convicted child molester, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.\nNeither Mann nor his lawyer, John B. Williams of the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Cozen O'Connor, were available for comment Tuesday afternoon. But on Facebook, where news of the lawsuit was initially posted Tuesday, Mann said the lawsuit was part of \"a battle\" to assist climate scientists in the fight against those who attack their work.\n\"There is a larger context for this latest development,\" he wrote, \"namely the onslaught of dishonest and libelous attacks that climate scientists have endured for years by dishonest front groups seeking to discredit the case for concern over climate change.\"\nBut he faces a high bar: Mann has played a key role in climate science for decades, and the law generally requires a much higher burden of proof from public figures, said CEI general counsel Sam Kazman.\n\"I don't think he's got a shot at reaching it,\" Kazman said in an interview. \"Our stuff may have been debatable, but it was solidly based and we had a perfect right to say what we did.\"\n\"We plan to defend the suit vigorously but we think it is a totally unfounded lawsuit.\"\nClick here to read Mann's complaint (PDF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead original story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinter-friendly version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransCanada Restarts Keystone Pipeline After Safety Issues \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOct 23, 2012\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    (AP)        \n\n\n\n\n\nOil resumed flowing Monday afternoon through the Keystone oil pipeline that carries about 590,000 barrels of crude per day from Canada to facilities in the Midwest.\nTransCanada had shut down the 2,100-mile pipeline Wednesday after tests showed possible safety issues. Company spokesman Shawn Howard said in an email that there were no leaks and \"the integrity of the pipeline system is sound.\"\nThe system will be operated at a slightly reduced pressure for about 24 hours so additional testing can be completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead original story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinter-friendly version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrogen Leak Reported at San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOct 22, 2012\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    (Voice of OC)        \n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station are working to fix a small hydrogen gas leak that began Sunday morning, according to the senior federal inspector at the plant.\nA \"very small\" amount of hydrogen has been leaking from a water treatment system for steam generators at Unit 2, said U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspector Gregory Warnick.\nA plant worker noticed abnormal pressure in the equipment, known as a \"chemical treatment skid,\" early Sunday, Warnick said.
