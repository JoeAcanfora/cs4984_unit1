An IOM team is today working with the Pakistan navy to deliver 1,000 shelter and item relief kits to families stranded in villages in the western Tando Bago area of Sindh Badin district The kits each containing two plastic tarpaulins two blankets a kitchen set and a bucket will be the first international assistance to reach the villages near Judho many of which have been cut off by flood waters since About 30kms east of Tando Bago town the road gets narrower and then disappears into a vast sea of water The marines are ferrying people to and from villages that have been cut off but no emergency shelter aid has reached them up to now says IOM Operations Officer Sher Sultan The operation which follows IOM distributions of some 2,500 tents and shelter kits in Badin over the past month will only meet a fraction of local shelter needs according to overwhelmed local government officials They believe that up to 1.7 million of the district 1.8 million residents have been affected by the floods the vast majority of them poor tenant farmers and their families In a government flood relief centre set up in a vocational training college in Badin 27-year-old tenant farmer Fida Hussain says that in his village in Nindo Shaher Union Council 35 kms from Badin all 200 houses are submerged in up to six feet of water together with 600 acres land The cotton rice sugar cane chili and tomato crops have all been destroyed by the floods and he expects to have to stay in the centre with 113 other families for two to three months before they can safely return home At a second government relief centre at another technical training college in Badin 50-year-old small landowner Muhammad Ghulam hopes that the 222 families from his community sheltering in the centre will be able to start returning home in a month or so Their adjacent villages in Gharo and Golarchi Union Councils also 35km from Badin are now submerged in up to five feet of flood water and most of the metal frame and wooden houses that replaced traditional mud huts have collapsed or sank in the mud together with the school and the mosque he says Their rice cotton and tomato crop was lost but 80 per cent of their cows water buffalos and sheep survived Some of the men took the livestock to dry ground to the east in Tharparkar district and when the water subsides they will return to the village he adds With nearly 90 per cent of Badin partially submerged by floodwaters displaced families sheltering in government relief centres represent less of a humanitarian challenge to the authorities and aid agencies than the thousands living in spontaneous settlements set up on roads or higher dry ground close to their often inaccessible villages Many families prefer to stay close to home rather than move into relief centres or camps even if they could reach them because they do want to mix with other communities We have to respect people beliefs but it makes getting aid to them much more difficult in terms of logistics says IOM Hyderabad Head of Office Arshad Rashid According to Pakistan National Disaster Management Authority NDMA over million people have now been affected by the flooding in all 23 districts in Sindh Nearly 1.5 million houses have been damaged or destroyed and over 716,000 individuals are now living in 3,079 relief camps The same number of displaced people may be living in unrecorded spontaneous settlements according to an independent rapid needs assessment Based on available data and the assessment of 2,547 temporary settlements completed nearly two weeks ago by IOM and partner agencies in the IASC Emergency Shelter Custer IOM is now appealing to international donors for US 14.6 million to procure and distribute emergency shelter and relief items to another 553,000 vulnerable people over the next three months The money will go towards providing shelter and relief items for the most vulnerable flood victims meeting the needs of displaced people in temporary settlements and relief camps tracking displacement building local capacity and coordinating the work of the Emergency Shelter Cluster says IOM Pakistan Chief of Mission Hassan Abdel Moneim Mostafa For more information on the work of the Emergency Shelter Cluster in the 2011 Pakistan floods please go to For free use of pictures copyright IOM please go to http For other information please contact Chris Lom in Sindh Tel Email clom Saleem Rehmat in Islamabad Tel Email srehmat For additional information Jemini Pandya Tel 41 22 717 9486 Mobile 41 79 217 33 74 Email jpandya Jumbe Omari Jumbe Tel 41 22 717 9405 Mobile 41 79 812 77 34 Email jjumbe ISDN Line 41 22 788 38 61

Even at the time it was seen as a turning point by officials managing relations with Pakistan but attack was glossed over to maintain the relationship with Islamabad A fine lot of good that did Pakistanis Tied to 2007 Border Attack on Americans by Carlotta Gall for the New York Times September 27 KABUL Afghanistan A group of American military officers and Afghan officials had just finished a meeting with their Pakistani hosts in a village schoolhouse settling a border dispute when they were ambushed by the Pakistanis An American major was killed and three American officers were wounded along with their Afghan interpreter in what fresh accounts from the Afghan and American officers who were there reveal was a complex calculated assault by a nominal ally The Pakistanis opened fire on the Americans who returned fire before escaping in a Black Hawk helicopter The attack in Teri Mangal on May 14 2007 was kept quiet by Washington which for much of a decade has seemed to play down or ignore signals that Pakistan would pursue its own interests or even sometimes behave as an Though both sides kept any deeper investigations of the ambush under wraps even at the time it was seen as a turning point by officials managing relations with Pakistan Pakistani officials first attributed the attack to militants then when pressed to investigate to a single rogue soldier from the Frontier Corps the poorly controlled tribal militia that guards the border region To this day none of the governments have publicly clarified what happened hoping to limit damage to relations Both the American and Pakistani military investigations remain classified The official line covered over the details in the interests of keeping the relationship with Pakistan intact said a former United Nations official who served in eastern Afghanistan and was briefed on the events immediately after they occurred At that time in May 2007 you had a lot of analysis pointing to the role of Pakistan in destabilizing that part of Afghanistan and here you had a case in point and for whatever reason it was glossed over he said The official did not want to be named for fear of alienating the Pakistanis with whom he must still work Exactly why the Pakistanis might have chosen Teri Mangal to make a stand and at what level the decision was made remain unclear Requests to the Pakistani military for information and interviews for this article were not answered One Pakistani official who was present at the meeting indicated that the issue was too sensitive to be discussed with a journalist Brig Martin Schweitzer the American commander in eastern Afghanistan at the time whose troops were involved also declined to be interviewed At first the meeting to resolve the border dispute seemed a success Despite some tense moments the delegations ate lunch together exchanged phone numbers and made plans to meet again Then as the Americans and Afghans prepared to leave the Pakistanis opened fire without warning The assault involved multiple gunmen Pakistani intelligence agents and military officers and an attempt to kidnap or draw away the senior American and Afghan officials To stem the flow of militants the Afghan government was building more border posts including one at Gawi in Jaji District one of the insurgents main crossing points according to Rahmatullah Rahmat then the governor of Paktia Province in eastern Afghanistan Pakistani forces objected to the new post claiming it was on Pakistani land and occupied it by force killing 13 Afghans Over the following days dozens were killed as Afghan and Pakistani forces traded mortar rounds and moved troops and artillery up to the border Afghanistans president Hamid Karzai began to talk of defending the border at all costs said Dan McNeill the senior American general in Afghanistan at the time The border meeting was called and a small group of Americans and Afghans 12 men in total flew by helicopters to Teri Mangal just inside Pakistan to try to resolve the dispute They included Rahmat The Afghans remember the meeting as difficult but ending in agreement The Pakistanis described it as cordial said Mahmood Shah a retired brigadier and a military analyst who has spoken to some of those present at the meeting The Americans say the experience was like refereeing children but after five hours of back and forth the Pakistanis agreed to withdraw from the post and the Afghans also agreed to abandon it Then just as the American and Afghan officials were climbing into vehicles provided to take them the short distance to a helicopter landing zone a Pakistani soldier opened fire with an automatic rifle pumping multiple rounds from just or 10 yards away into an American officer Larry Bauguess killing him almost instantly An operations officer with the 82nd Airborne Division from North Carolina Major Bauguess 36 was married and the father of two girls ages and An American soldier immediately shot and killed the attacker but at the same instant several other Pakistanis opened fire from inside the classrooms riddling the group and the cars with gunfire according to the two senior Afghan

A newborns displacement in Badin September 16th 2011 by Oxfam Posted in Pakistan September 13 2011 By Tariq Masood Malik Rains discriminate no one Not even a kid as young as days While witnessing the ravages of rain in the southern Sindh I stopped at a relief camp in Nandu area of Badin district A middle aged man who appeared to be a flood affectee beckoned me to come and meet a family that had taken shelter in a brick shed that is actually meant for passengers travelling along the road to use for rest There was a curtain a of nylon on the door and inside a woman was sat hunched on the floor baking bread I was soon to find out that her name was Lal Khatoon who on seeing me approach immediately got up and allowed me in Lal Khatoon with her daughter Abida It was a small by foot room that was housing families comprising around 30 people Men women and children all huddled up around me probably in the hope of a hand out Suddenly I caught glimpse of a little baby Lal Khatoon was holding in the crook of her arm Lal Khatoon comes from Single Chak Shadi Lal in Badin District the first and most badly affected district in the recent rains She looks older than her years Though she does not exactly know the year of her birth she is told by other women around her she is under thirty She gave birth to her seventh child during the current rains She already had sons and as many daughters She was lucky not to have faced any complications during childbirth as there was no trained health worker present at the time of her delivery But immediately after her child was born she was faced with another challenge Her baby girl was days old when the roof of her house gave in to incessant rains Her district Badin is reported to have witnessed continuous rains from second week of August It is located in an area that receives much outflow from the Left Bank Outfall Drain aka LBOD a World Bank project that has repeatedly proven to be faulty over the 15 years since its construction and during these rains breaches in the drain have inundated Badin with water Lal Khatoon had to leave on foot and without any wherewithal not that she had any to take with her as it had all been soaked by the floods She and her husband work as sharecroppers on a local landlords land After working on the land for a year her family gets to keep of the total crop which is barely enough to sustain them There is no excess once she has seen to the needs of her family and so Lal Khatoon has no savings She and her other clan members walked for miles carrying her newborn baby Abida of God and other younger children She and her cousin took it in turns to carry Abida After trudging for hours a military vehicle picked them up and transported them to a government camp in Union Council Nando When I asked who named her baby she said her father we dont have a tradition of women naming their kids Its the mens domain She suffers a lot of problems in the passengers shed she lives in by the roadside But in some ways her family is fortunate as many others dont have this facility at all The compound of an adjacent camp set up in a school building looks a pond and people have great difficulty moving around and using the toilets The site is inundated with mosquitoes which further increases the difficulties Khatoon says I am not feeling well after days of struggle at home to save my children and livestock now the mosquitoes and lack of water and food has drained me of all the energy I need to face homelessness in such terrible weather Her child who silently stared at the ceiling all this while starts whimpering for a feed She tries covering her child under her skimpy perforated shawl so that she can feed her but wasnt able to because there were many males around Abida seemed not to insist and Khatoon drops the idea of feeding her in full public view Khatoon gets a ten kg bag of flour from government which she is told will be delivered after every ten days This is the maximum amount they have at any one time We manage by skipping meals and by eating a quarter or sometimes if were lucky a half a piece of bread During the rains they went without food for 10 days as the stock they had only lasted for a week I asked her whether she will tell Abida when she is older about the troubles she is going through now Instead of replying to this she thought of her water buffalo that she shared with another family Like me it also had a baby but it died in heavy rains due to the lack of shelter Her constant fear is how will she manage to care for her child who is already sick with skin rashes and diarrhea How will she build back her house The land is under water and it will take at least months for it to be cultivable again We would probably starve to death or die of cold I could offer no solace When asked to be pictured with Abida she agrees with a broad smile on her face She wrapped Abida into a small shawl and then wished us Her eyes were glittering with hope this interview might cause some help to come to her soon The question is will it

Media screens all across Pakistan and the world have been occupied by the grief stricken families from the recent floods which are well above 20 million across Pakistan until now Some where between this I was shocked to see the images which closely resembled the terrible days of TTP in Swat Two boys hanging upside down from a pole with blood rushing out from every part of their body but above all this they were still breathing of course not for long Later in the day the screens again flashed with mobile clips showing the exact event where right in the middle of the city a mob had gathered along with a sizeable presence of police To my amazement and horror some people in the presence of all these entities were beating the two unfortunate brothers from Sialkot in a manner which is regrettable even for the animals With sticks in their hand it took few minutes for both of these living souls to reach their painful and merciless climax Later as usual reports were tempered alleging them as bandits which were taken to task by the natives Ofcourse we are not talking about streets of Karachi where a campaign like this started After being haunted by street crimes for years the Karachiites were force to take such action just to make the law enforcing agencies realize what they are placed to do which was also wrong entirely Now it is reported that the whole barbaric episode was caused by a petty fight over some cricket match which turned so ugly After witnessing the reports the top court headed by CJ Iftikhar has started the suo moto action against the alleged culprits of the episode The nominated law breakers also include police officials from that area and rightly so The proceeding and legal formalities will take its due time until we see those responsible for this act behind the bars for good Having said this there are other aspects to this unfortunate episode as well The police officials for sure never intervened thats clear but one is left amazed regarding the mindset of the mob which had gathered at the scene By not stopping it in any way possible nearly all of them have supported this barbaric event in one way or the other For our police standing as spectator they are morally dead and they should be punished in a manner which becomes an example for others in uniform Except showing their muscles on innocent and the weak like we saw outside Bahawalpur Medical college its rare that they have committed something worth mentioning To the honorable CM of Punjab it is requested that in the list of your reform policy for Punjab allot the top slot to this wild Police Culture prevailing in the province For the family of these two brothers CJ Iftikhar has emerged as a ray of hope and we are sure that atlast justice will be done to those whom naming human is a disgrace to humanity

monsoon rains in the coming days low caste Hindus in Sindhs flood affected areas face discrimination when it comes to getting relief says a report released by Hong Asian Human Rights Commission The worst victims of rains and breaches in a Left Bank Outfall Drain LBOD in Badin district the Pakistani low caste Hindus Dalits of the districts were denied to get in to relief camps for being untouchables In the last five weeks when drains and LBOD burst its banks and led to massive flooding religious discrimination continued to run deeper than the floodwaters Despite torrential rains majority of these Hindu Dalits in Badin district continue to live in open sky as they were not allowed accommodation in the relief camps of Muslims What added to the tragedy was the federal governments ban on NGOs and international donors to work in these areas for security reasons As the government itself initiated relief operation much later the many religious organisations that started relief operation in Badin have completely ignored these Dalits or Harijan Children of God Chanesar Bheel a Dalit farmer and resident of Goth Gomando Bheel Taluka Golarchi Shaheed Fazil Rahu is one of around 700 Dalits of his village who have no choice but to live in their submerged village with his nine children Our village is between the two drains and during rains both burst and inundated our village from either side so we rushed to a nearby relief camps set inside a government school The tenants did not allow us to live inside the camp so we came here and started living under open sky Bheel told media Bheel said the people living inside the camps had told them that they are outcastes so they are not allowed to live with Muslims His village comprises on 80 households with 700 population and all are Dalits A civil society activist Ameer Mandhro sharing his views said This is not the only village of Dalits in the district that have no roof on their heads but there are countless other Dalit villages including villages on Khoski road Seerani Lonwari Shrief and other areas where Dalits are living this way because they are not allowed a place in the relief camps Same happened with Pirbhu Kolhi and 50 other residents of his village who rushed to a relief camp set inside a government school in Tando Bagho were not allowed to live in the camp after heavy rains However some nice folks allowed them to live inside a camp and allotted one isolated class room to a few Dalit flood victims As Kolhi said The isolated class room is away from the main building where only two families are living while the rest of the village is living in open despite continued heavy rains He said some philanthropists came to provide food in the relief camp but we are not given the food In the emergency situation the role of the minister for minorities affairs Mohan Lal Kohistani seeks attention The situation remains tough for the government which not only hails from Sindh but

discrimination The Express Tribune KARACHI President Asif Ali Zardari has demanded a report from the Sindh government into news reports that scheduled caste Hindus Dalits affected by floods were being denied humanitarian assistance The president said that discrimination on the basis of caste creed or religion in extending rescue relief and rehabilitation operations is unacceptable Presidential Spokesperson Farhatullah Babar quoted the president as saying The president he said ordered that immediate relief be provided to all marooned and stranded people including those from minority groups and asked the Sindh chief minister to solve the problem The havoc caused by floods is a humanitarian disaster which calls for a response beyond partisan or religious considerations the president said Media outlets have reported that organisations conducting relief efforts and not just the religious ones have been discriminating against the scheduled castes according to Hindu community chiefs Dalits have not only been denied help but have also not been allowed to enter relief camps for being untouchables There are an estimated two million Dalits living in Pakistan today and Sindhs scheduled castes including the Kohlis Menghwars Bheels and Oads are predominantly employed as farmers in Badin district These Hindu farmers usually take loans from landlords and tend to the land with their families all year round to pay back As such they are most vulnerable to the devastating rains and ensuing floods Similar reports had appeared last year during the floods as well mostly focusing on discrimination against Ahmadis in Punjab The mercy forgiveness can be bestowed by everyone But the glory resides only for the snake with the venom What value is the mercy of the soft kind Like the

their homes in Tando Allah Yar district near Hyderabad Pakistan 20 2011 AP Bardou AP PANGRIO Pakistan Desperate to save his grandmother from floodwaters swamping southern Pakistan Ali Ahmed and three other relatives stuck her in a large metal cooking pot and pulled her to safety through water The men swam for several hours through driving rain unable to rest because the water was too deep It was the most experience of my life and I will never forget it said Ahmed surrounded by a couple dozen white tents set up outside Pangrio town on the only patch of dry ground for miles around The rescuers finally reached a road and transported Rasti Bibi to a hospital in Pangrio where she was treated for acute diarrhea said Ahmed The town like much of southern Sindh province is under water Pakistani authorities are unsure how many people are still stranded by floods that first hit Pakistan in August following unusually heavy monsoon rains and have affected at least 5.4 million people In Sindh alone the floods have killed over 220 people damaged or destroyed some 665,000 homes and displaced more than 1.8 million people according to the United Nations Neighboring Baluchistan province has also been affected Bibi family ferried her to safety about three weeks ago but the other 300 members of their village Suleman Hamadani were only saved a few days ago by the military said Ahmed The air force commandos who made up the rescue team said they happened upon the villagers as they were searching the area by boat Earlier we had an impression that all have been evacuated but we realized during our operation that many villagers still need to be rescued said one of the commandos speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media This area is and also beyond the capacity of the civilian rescue workers The Pakistani government was widely criticized last year for its stuttering response to the worst floods in the country history which affected at least 18 million people and inundated of Pakistan an area the size of the United Kingdom The floods have been less severe this year but have still sparked criticism of the government which is widely disliked and is already struggling against Islamist militants political turmoil and massive economic problems Sindh experienced widespread flooding last year as well While some of the districts have been flooded twice many of the towns and villages such as Pangrio and Suleman Hamadani were unaffected in 2010 The Pakistan army said it has rescued 58,000 people from the current floods and has distributed 885 tons of rations But being rescued is just one step in a long road to recovery for many flood victims especially the very old and young Bibi the elderly grandmother who relatives estimate is over 100 years old lay stretched out on the rough ground outside her tent weakly raising bony hands to swat flies away from her wrinkled face Her family does know what will happen to them since their village was entirely flooded We lost everything and our children are sick said Bibi grandson Ahmed The World Food Program said Tuesday that some million people are in need of food assistance in Sindh The issued an appeal Sunday for 357 million to provide food water sanitation health and emergency shelter to flood victims But filling the appeal after raising at least billion for last year floods could prove difficult We look to our donors and their usual generosity to help us reach all those in immediate need following this latest disaster while ensuring that the recovery of those affected last year is not compromised said the World Food Program acting country director in Pakistan Dominique Frankefort 2011 The Associated Press All Rights Reserved This material may not be

Although flooding is being tracked in four provinces across the country the disaster is concentrated in Sindh province where 22 out of 23 districts are affected In Sindh alone flood waters have pushed more than 300,000 people out of their homes and into relief sites at hundreds of schools as well as in public buildings and impromptu camps on embankments and beside roads Currently up to 140,000 children are living in relief sites throughout Sindh UNICEF Pakistan Representative Dan Rohrmann visited Badin District in southern Sindh one of the areas Rohrmann spoke with families about their situation and witnessed the appalling conditions that many children and families continue to endure In Badin District More than a million people are affected and more than 80,000 are living in camps said Rohrmann Many times the families had to leave their homes and leave everything behind and just come with their family and maybe with their livestock

The recent monsoon driven devastating floods in Pakistan had not been less than a nightmare for the Pakistanis in specific and for the world in general At least 1,600 people have died in the regions worst deluge in 80 years with more than 14 million people being affected World Bank President Robert Zoellick said that the worst floods in Pakistan in decades were likely to have destroyed crops in the country worth around billion Raging waters have spread from the northwest to the Punjab agricultural heartland and then down to the southern province of Sindh as Pakistanis watched villages collapse thousands of people drown and millions displaced Maurizio Giuliano a spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has described Pakistan as going through an experience that was far worse than the December 26 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami the October 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the January 13 2010 Haiti earthquake 

In the a dam that irrigated nearly 200,000 acres of farmland has been is still unknown how much damage has been caused to the irrigation system in Punjab and Sindh provinces which is the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world and has been entirely flooded 

Pakistan had a bumper crop last year so there is no immediate food shortage in the country A substantial amount of farmland has been inundated by flood waters But millions of acres of pulse and rice crops have been washed away which may lead to shortages and high prices Especially the damages to cotton crop which is the main export and a major source of foreign exchange for Pakistan are large and it tantamount to huge loss in agriculture sector

USAID Responds to Devastating Floods in Pakistan Heavy rains in late July and August have caused massive flooding across Pakistan As of 16 the deadly flood waters had claimed the lives of a reported 1,400 people washed away close to 900,000 homes decimated crops killed scores of livestock and left billions of dollars worth of damage in their wake The United Nations estimates that more than 15 million people have been affected by the floods and as the monsoon rains continue there is a growing need to address critical health concerns 

Not surprisingly little appears to have changed since the last round of flooding Floods wanted by the government Caritas the only channel that gives humanitarian aid to religious minorities from Agenzia Fides September 22 Islamabad Agenzia Fides The only channel to get humanitarian aid to displaced people belonging to religious minorities Christians and Hindus is Caritas although government agencies and other Muslim NGOs deny it says Fr Mario Rodrigues to Fides national Director of the Pontifical Mission Societies PMS in Pakistan after severe floods hit Sindh in past weeks causing over million refugees and 1.1 million homes damaged or destroyed The Director of the PMS said We must be careful After the floods of 2010 Catholic organizations have also provided humanitarian aid through local NGOs but did not give assistance to religious minorities During the severe floods of 2010 several sources denounced discrimination in the distribution of humanitarian aid which were denied to religious minorities Now such incidents have been repeated in the district of Bedin Fr Rodrigues complains What seems clear from this latest tragedy is that the government has failed in the prevention It wanted the floods and allowed the floods to devastate in order to receive money from abroad The poor people suffer the consequences Among the thousands displaced are Christians who live in almost all the districts of Sindh The United Nations has issued an appeal for solidarity to raise 365 million dollars in favor of the affected populations But the donor countries are asking the Pakistani government to establish a monitoring system to ensure transparency in aid management and to control that the funds actually reach the flood victims Much of the money raised in 2010 in fact according to the denunciation of some observers went lost in the rivulets of corruption cronyism and misgovernment

The 2010 floods in Pakistan displaced millions and were a major setback for the national economy They affected vast areas mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Punjab and Sindh and took a toll of hundreds of the repeated statements from the government no practical steps were taken to tackle the possibility of future floods and the consequence of this gross negligence is that floods are yet again wrecking havoc this year Unlike last year the eye of the storm this year is Sindh where flood waters have razed in numerous villages and displaced millions According to Asian Human Rights Commission the loss of crops due to floods in Sindh is estimated to have caused 5.6 billion rupees in damages The extent of inundation can be gauged from the fact that out of 23 districts of Sindh 22 have been directly or indirectly affected by the deluge Aerial view of Shahdadpur which has been inundated by widespread flooding Image by Rajput Yasir copyright Demotix 18/9/2011 Lamenting the utter lack of efficiency on the part of the government to tackle the situation the Human Rights Commission article states It is only now that thegovernmentis examining the conditionsofthe bunds and embankments which are only just if at all holding the flood waters at bay In the meantime hundredsofthousandsofpeople are trapped due to the floodingofthe roads and it is the women and children who are suffering the most due to the lackofsafe drinking water milk and food As was seen in the last catastrophe the response from thegovernmentwas very slow due to the lackofa proper relief system and resources Like last year a number of social initiatives have been launched to help out the displaced flood affectees Among these efforts is the one launched by Faisal Kapadia and Dr Awab Alvi two notable social activists and bloggers and Global Voices authors Faisal writing about the objectives of his relief efforts states on his blog Our plan is initially to provide them cooked meals for the next 15 days in order to at least give them a chance of returning to their lives once the rain waters subside A man with his children under the water moving towards a safe place Image by Rajput Yasir copyright Demotix 16/9/2011 Commenting on the disaster wrecked by the floods Faisal tells Vast swathes of land on either side of the road were completely inundated with water I have been working in flood relief since 2010 and I have to say that I have not seen this much water in my entire life The flooding is so intense that for several stretches there is no land in sight at all In fact I felt like I was driving in the middle of the sea it was terrifying and saddening at the same time Beena Sarwar a notable Pakistani journalist and activist has been actively highlighting credible relief efforts on her blog The groups she highlighted include Pakistan Medical Association Indus Foundation Trust and IRC A recent post on floods details upon the updates from Khairpur a region in Sindh There is no proper arrangement of medical facilities neither from Government nor from the NGOs There has been an outbreak of skin disease flu gastro and malaria People are drinking stagnant flood water and are demanding safe drinking water Temporary latrines have not yet been installed and school latrines are insufficient and Protection of most vulnerable particularly women and children also seems to be one of the major issues Millions have been affected by floods across Pakistan with thousands forced to vacate their homes Image by Rajput Yasir copyright Demotix 7/9/2011 The most unfortunate part of the entire episode is that the media and Pakistani blogosphere barely seems to care about the floods at large Of course there are exceptions but compared to last years immense response Pakistani netizens are relatively mute Commenting on this apathy Tazeen an active Pakistani blogger says in her post titled South is flooded and the rest of Pakistan does not care 

ABU DHABI Relief collection drive to help survivors in the areas of Pakistan has gained momentum in the UAE Mission officials as well as community leaders have appealed members of the expatriate community to donate generously as the situation is still of Pakistan to the UAE Jamil Ahmad Khan called upon the community members to come forward to help their brethren back home who have been suffering from the flood effects Addressing prominent members of the community at the premises of Pakistan Embassy in Abu Dhabi the Ambassador said that the relief camps set up in the affected areas face serious shortage of medicines and essential items He said that the gravity and seriousness of the flood is much more than peoples expectations and anticipated that the relief campaign will take a long flood has affected 7.3 million people in Sindh province and there is an urgent need of food items shelter and medicines to cater to the affected people New clothes for men women and children blankets mattresses trousers tents tarpaulin sheets are the main items required urgently Donors have also been suggested to donate only dry foodstuff like energy biscuits dry milk dates as it is difficult to transport items to the affected sites said that at present the focus is only on collecting the needful things and sending it to the affected areas However he also underlined the need to gear up efforts and to be ready for winter We also need to be ready for inadequacies and gaps in the relief effort I hope people will respond positively he appreciated the UAE government and said that all channels have been mobilised as seven major charity organisations have been directed to send relief material Although no pledge has been made the UAE has already sent its first team and consignment for immediate community members may visit the Embassy in Abu Dhabi or the Consulate General of Pakistan in Dubai to make PIA has also joined the drive and announced free transportation of relief material An official suggested community members to deliver the packets of essential items should be left at the Cargo Village in Abu Dhabi and Dubai 

The men swam for several hours through driving rain unable to rest because the water was too deep It was the most experience of my life and I will never forget it said Ahmed surrounded by a couple dozen white tents set up outside Pangrio town on the only patch of dry ground for miles around The rescuers finally reached a road and transported Rasti Bibi to a hospital in Pangrio where she was treated for acute diarrhea said Ahmed The town like much of southern Sindh province is under water Pakistani authorities are unsure how many people are still stranded by floods that first hit Pakistan in August following unusually heavy monsoon rains and have affected at least 5.4 million people In Sindh alone the floods have killed over 220 people damaged or destroyed some 665,000 homes and displaced more than 1.8 million people according to the United Nations Neighboring Baluchistan province has also been affected Bibis family ferried her to safety about three weeks ago but the other 300 members of their village Suleman Hamadani were only saved a few days ago by the military said Ahmed The air force commandos who made up the rescue team said they happened upon the villagers as they were searching the area by boat Earlier we had an impression that all have been evacuated but we realized during our operation that many villagers still need to be rescued said one of the commandos speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media This area is and also beyond the capacity of the civilian rescue workers The Pakistani government was widely criticized last year for its stuttering response to the worst floods in the countrys history which affected at least 18 million people and inundated of Pakistan an area the size of the United Kingdom The floods have been less severe this year but have still sparked criticism of the government which is widely disliked and is already struggling against Islamist militants political turmoil and massive economic problems Sindh experienced widespread flooding last year as well While some of the districts have been flooded twice many of the towns and villages such as Pangrio and Suleman Hamadani were unaffected in 2010 The Pakistan army said it has rescued 58,000 people from the current floods and has distributed 885 tons of rations But being rescued is just one step in a long road to recovery for many flood victims especially the very old and young Bibi the elderly grandmother who relatives estimate is over 100 years old lay stretched out on the rough ground outside her tent weakly raising bony hands to swat flies away from her wrinkled face Her family doesnt know what will happen to them since their village was entirely flooded We lost everything and our children are sick said Bibis grandson Ahmed The World Food Program said Tuesday that some million people are in need of food assistance in Sindh The issued an appeal Sunday for 357 million to provide food water sanitation health and emergency shelter to flood victims But filling the appeal after raising at least billion for last years floods could prove difficult We look to our donors and their usual generosity to help us reach all those in immediate need following this latest disaster while ensuring that the recovery of those affected last year is not compromised said the World Food Programs acting country director in Pakistan Dominique Frankefort 

By Muhammed Muheisen APA Pakistani woman displaced by floodwaters carries a young boy while crossing a flooded way near Hyderabad Pakistan on Muhammed Muheisen APA Pakistani woman displaced by floodwaters carries a young boy while crossing a flooded way near Hyderabad Pakistan on rains since early August have killed more than 220 people damaged or destroyed some 665,000 homes and displaced more than 1.8 million people in the southern Sindh province according to the government and the United Nations which Sunday made an emergency appeal for funding First it started to rain then water gathered here and there and later the floods came said Mohammad Hashim who was sitting by the side of a main road in Badin district We did not get any relief We are helpless with nothing left to eat Where do we go The road is the highest stretch of land in the area and on either side the floods stretch for kilometers miles saw similar scenes during last year floods which at their peak affected all four of the country provinces and triggered a massive international aid response While some districts in the region have been flooded out twice many of the towns and villagers this year were unaffected in 2010.The return of the floods is testament to the powerful penetration of the monsoon rains that envelop much of Asia at the end of summer It also points to the limits of Pakistan government often blasted as weak and corrupt During normal times Islamabad officials are seen as barely helping the rain did last year the floods are undercutting the legitimacy of the shaky government which is widely disliked and struggling against Islamist militants political turmoil and massive economic Rafiq an army soldier involved in rescue and relief work said there was little coordination The affected people have set up their tents where they felt it was suitable There are so few dry and safe places available to them Thousands of people flushed from their homes in some of the country poorest villages have made temporary shelters from bits of plastic cloth and wood Many had brought household possessions like beds and pots and pans with them Some had brought their cows which were tethered on the 52-bed Badin Civil Hospital was treating more than 100 Zadi said she had to carry her younger sister Begum on her back through the waters after she was bitten by one of the many snakes that have been disturbed by the floods Begum was lying on a dirty bed with flies buzzing around It was unclear whether the snake was 20-year-old Zubaida Ismail was recovering from a miscarriage that occurred when her house months pregnant she lay bleeding in the remains of her home until an army boat appeared and took her to safety then to the hospital her sister doctor at the hospital Rahim Rahimoo said the situation there was under control but he was concerned about waterborne diseases and malaria noting that the volume of patients was increasing 2010 the floods followed the course of the River Indus and its tributaries from the foothills of the Himalayas to the flatlands of Sindh where the river empties out into the Arabian of the countries that helped out then including the have mobilized again this year to assist said it paid for food packages for 23,000 families and its local partners will soon begin handing out tents clean water and other supplies Japan and China have also pledged relief goods or money according to the Pakistan government The numbers of affectees are growing by the day and we would like to be able to reach as many people as possible with humanitarian assistance so hopefully they can return to homes and recover said Stacey Melissa Winston a spokeswoman for the United 2011 The Associated Press All rights reserved This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

Not surprisingly little appears to have changed since the last round of flooding Floods wanted by the government Caritas the only channel that gives humanitarian aid to religious minorities from Agenzia Fides September 22 Islamabad Agenzia Fides The only channel to get humanitarian aid to displaced people belonging to religious minorities Christians and Hindus is Caritas although government agencies and other Muslim NGOs deny it says Fr Mario Rodrigues to Fides national Director of the Pontifical Mission Societies PMS in Pakistan after severe floods hit Sindh in past weeks causing over million refugees and 1.1 million homes damaged or destroyed The Director of the PMS said We must be careful After the floods of 2010 Catholic organizations have also provided humanitarian aid through local NGOs but did not give assistance to religious minorities During the severe floods of 2010 several sources denounced discrimination in the distribution of humanitarian aid which were denied to religious minorities Now such incidents have been repeated in the district of Bedin Fr Rodrigues complains What seems clear from this latest tragedy is that the government has failed in the prevention It wanted the floods and allowed the floods to devastate in order to receive money from abroad The poor people suffer the consequences Among the thousands displaced are Christians who live in almost all the districts of Sindh The United Nations has issued an appeal for solidarity to raise 365 million dollars in favor of the affected populations But the donor countries are asking the Pakistani government to establish a monitoring system to ensure transparency in aid management and to control that the funds actually reach the flood victims Much of the money raised in 2010 in fact according to the denunciation of some observers went lost in the rivulets of corruption cronyism and misgovernment

monsoon rains in the coming days low caste Hindus in Sindhs flood affected areas face discrimination when it comes to getting relief says a report released by Hong Asian Human Rights Commission The worst victims of rains and breaches in a Left Bank Outfall Drain LBOD in Badin district the Pakistani low caste Hindus Dalits of the districts were denied to get in to relief camps for being untouchables In the last five weeks when drains and LBOD burst its banks and led to massive flooding religious discrimination continued to run deeper than the floodwaters Despite torrential rains majority of these Hindu Dalits in Badin district continue to live in open sky as they were not allowed accommodation in the relief camps of Muslims What added to the tragedy was the federal governments ban on NGOs and international donors to work in these areas for security reasons As the government itself initiated relief operation much later the many religious organisations that started relief operation in Badin have completely ignored these Dalits or Harijan Children of God Chanesar Bheel a Dalit farmer and resident of Goth Gomando Bheel Taluka Golarchi Shaheed Fazil Rahu is one of around 700 Dalits of his village who have no choice but to live in their submerged village with his nine children Our village is between the two drains and during rains both burst and inundated our village from either side so we rushed to a nearby relief camps set inside a government school The tenants did not allow us to live inside the camp so we came here and started living under open sky Bheel told media Bheel said the people living inside the camps had told them that they are outcastes so they are not allowed to live with Muslims His village comprises on 80 households with 700 population and all are Dalits A civil society activist Ameer Mandhro sharing his views said This is not the only village of Dalits in the district that have no roof on their heads but there are countless other Dalit villages including villages on Khoski road Seerani Lonwari Shrief and other areas where Dalits are living this way because they are not allowed a place in the relief camps Same happened with Pirbhu Kolhi and 50 other residents of his village who rushed to a relief camp set inside a government school in Tando Bagho were not allowed to live in the camp after heavy rains However some nice folks allowed them to live inside a camp and allotted one isolated class room to a few Dalit flood victims As Kolhi said The isolated class room is away from the main building where only two families are living while the rest of the village is living in open despite continued heavy rains He said some philanthropists came to provide food in the relief camp but we are not given the food In the emergency situation the role of the minister for minorities affairs Mohan Lal Kohistani seeks attention The situation remains tough for the government which not only hails from Sindh but

discrimination The Express Tribune KARACHI President Asif Ali Zardari has demanded a report from the Sindh government into news reports that scheduled caste Hindus Dalits affected by floods were being denied humanitarian assistance The president said that discrimination on the basis of caste creed or religion in extending rescue relief and rehabilitation operations is unacceptable Presidential Spokesperson Farhatullah Babar quoted the president as saying The president he said ordered that immediate relief be provided to all marooned and stranded people including those from minority groups and asked the Sindh chief minister to solve the problem The havoc caused by floods is a humanitarian disaster which calls for a response beyond partisan or religious considerations the president said Media outlets have reported that organisations conducting relief efforts and not just the religious ones have been discriminating against the scheduled castes according to Hindu community chiefs Dalits have not only been denied help but have also not been allowed to enter relief camps for being untouchables There are an estimated two million Dalits living in Pakistan today and Sindhs scheduled castes including the Kohlis Menghwars Bheels and Oads are predominantly employed as farmers in Badin district These Hindu farmers usually take loans from landlords and tend to the land with their families all year round to pay back As such they are most vulnerable to the devastating rains and ensuing floods Similar reports had appeared last year during the floods as well mostly focusing on discrimination against Ahmadis in Punjab The mercy forgiveness can be bestowed by everyone But the glory resides only for the snake with the venom What value is the mercy of the soft kind Like the

Though he has lived in the United States since 1974 Khatak has personally felt the pain of this crisis A sister uncle and a number of his nieces and nephews still live in what was formerly known as the Northwest Province Although his family is fortunate enough to live in an area where the floodwaters have so far only covered up fields Khatak said he has heard stories of great tragedy In one of the villages near Peshawar a friend of ours who is doing well had 200 people in the house who ran from the water to get shelter Khatak said This was the only safe place where they could be and now he is running out of food and out of firewood and he is asking for help so that people can eat Early this week monsoon rains poured into the region overflowing river banks and unleashing the floods Since many inhabitants of the region dwell in mud houses and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods the flooding has had the dual effect of destroying both homes and means of survival The Associated Press reported that relief work for some 3.2 million people has been delayed by swamped roads bridges and downed communication lines and survivors have complained about government inaction It is also estimated that as many as 1.8 million Pakistanis will need food assistance for at least the next month because the flooding hit the Punjab region that is home to many of the nations farms A cousin of mine his house fell down Khatek said but they were not inside the room and therefore they did not get hurt Others have not been so fortunate he said Pakistans military and government has been criticized by the population for inaction For a government that has struggled in the past year to deter the population from dissent in favor of the Taliban it marks a major setback I think it might make things a little worse said Mount Holyoke College professor Kavita Khory who specializes in the study of south Asian security But the situation is bad enough to begin with and I think this is something that will take some time before one can assess what could and couldnt have been done The Obama administration has already promised 10 million in aid Khory said such aid is important on a basic humanitarian level Most actions are political but in this case its very welcome and the more aid and assistance the provides the better it will be for them said Khory I think this is a great diplomatic opportunity for the source 

Dr Geet Chainani in the field NEED food medicines water tents Pakistan was still reeling from the devastating floods of last year when fresh disaster struck The situation is worse than reported messaged the journalist and activist Aslam Khwaja back in Karachi after a recent visit to six districts of Sindh Many others working in the affected areas have relayed similar obervations as they scramble to renew their efforts Young Doctors Assocation volunteer at Mirpurkhas relief camp URGENTLY NEED MEDICINES 8.1 million people are homeless with less than a quarter of them approx 0.71 million accommodated in about 3,000 makeshift relief camps set up by the Sindh Government Conditions are appalling with severe shortage of food water and medical supplies Some 370 people have died hundreds more injured and some 6.1 million acres of land and 1.5 million houses underwater or severely damaged according to the National Disaster Management Authority NDMA of Pakistan The estimated loss to the cotton crop is estimated at a staggering Rs 75 billion YOU CAN HELP by sending money and relief goods to the organization of your choice The most urgent needs are tents food clean water medicine PIA is transporting relief goods free of cost to Pakistan but when sending donations please coordinate the donation beforehand and ensure you have a reliable point person to receive it or the material risks being held up in customs or for lack of payment of various duties and taxes points out Dr Geet Chainani who runs Lifebridge in the flood hit areas of Dadu and Thatta She notes that because these services are new there are processes involved that not everyone is aware of Donors need to ensure that the recipients of their relief goods in Pakistan wont end up paying duties and taxes or arranging transport which drains their already stretched financial and manpower resources It doesnt help when someone tells me theres a truckload of water bottles to be collected from Karachi she says I need that water but to arrange the transport from Karachi to Dadu is costly Its better to send money so we can buy the water or medicines in areas close to us or get someone to take care of

Floods in Sindh southern Pakistan Photo Alexopoulos If you want something important done dont do it on Christmas Day everyone will be away I remember my buddy joking while we were bouncing around inside a Series Land Rover on a security training exercise in New Zealand some time ago Flash forward to Pakistan in August 2011 I am driving with our CARE team leader Karuna in a Toyota 4x4 on a field assessment in central Sindh It is Eid a major holiday the end of the Ramadan All our staff including the drivers have gone to their home villages to be with their families and the country is on standstill observing national celebrations after a month of fasting for Ramadan The heavy monsoon rainfall and rising waters have us a little on edge We have no idea that our response will be one of the first by an NGO right at the heart of another emergency As the rain continued for almost full days Karuna would suggest areas he was interested in visiting and we would dart around the region hoping for access and a return route on roads that were at risk of closing We monitored the river and swelling canals inspecting for damage and trouble spots I was liaising frantically back with our country office via Blackberry snapping shots between wiper blade strokes and potholes and taking notes in my little time to time we would stop to stretch our legs and reflect on the disaster unfolding before our eyes The roads around Dadu were eerily quiet with no sign of the infamous chaotic traffic only the drumming of persistent rain pelting the roads By parking next to the door of our staff house in town we could climb into the car to avoid wading through over a foot of water mixed with garbage and stinking sewage In rural areas we saw mud houses melting away like chocolate When the rain stopped we knew that a new deluge of work was coming our way CARE staff and our local partners were headed back to the field office They would need an immediate and accurate account of the situation Media paints one story helicopter rides another but eyes on the ground cant be beat We were there on the ground Within days after only a small break in the weather Southern Sindh was hit much harder Roadsides and school grounds became crowded with families who had lost their homes Our nearby warehouse was packed with emergency stocks ready for distribution tarpaulins for temporary shelter mats shawls cooking utensils hygiene sets with antibacterial soap tanks for safe water storage Our holiday would have to wait Theo Alexopoulos is Deputy Safety and Security Manager of CARE Pakistan

Thousands of local residents are expected to evacuate as Pakistan Sindh province faces flood threats And authorities have urged people to vacate the areas immediately More flooding is due in Pakistan devastated Sindh Province and nearly half a million people are expected to evacuate As the crisis deepened villagers trailed toward the north in vans laden with furniture crowded into buses or in carts pulled by oxen Some people were on foot leading their livestock Rasool Baksh Resident Most of the people evacuating have arranged their own transport Some have been given vehicles by the local opposition party leader But so far no government official has come here The people who have come here only ask for huge amounts of money Local authorities have directed villagers to leave their land immediately Sahib Deno Shah Resident After the breach in Kot Aalimo our houses were inundated We had to run for our lives leaving all our valuables behind The breach occurred late at night and unfortunately the government made no arrangements for evacuation There was not a single officer no one to save us Officials have only visited the devastation in helicopters We are only relying on God now We are taking our children and some luggage leaving our houses and everything behind Floodwater is moving toward Sujawal and Thatta cities Thousands of people have already relocated to safer places The catastrophe has already affected more than 17 million people b 

BBC News Flood waters across Pakistan Sindh province have destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and flooded 4.2 million acres since late August according to the UN with the rains showing little sign of abating The situation in Sindh is already serious and there will be more flooding and more problems because of these rains meteorology department 

Unfortunately the drive to generate a public response to help lessen the miseries of the flood affectees with financial aid and relief goods is not up to the required mark this year The electronic media is not creating awareness about the hardships of the flood victims in the enthusiastic way it did last year Is it not double standard of the Media The sluggish response might be that flood has hit Sindh and area of Balochistan not Punjab There might a massive and affective campaign God forbid if all that happened to Punjab One can also observe that almost all the channels are focusing on Dengue and less coverage has been given to flood victims Death by Dengue is sad indeed but at the same time we should forget the flood victims as they are badly suffering from this natural disaster Our hapless brethren in Sindh are stranded in floodwater and they need our help Citizens from the developed areas and big cities must come out of their comfort zones and initiate campaigns in their circles to gather relief goods including food clean water clothes tents and medicines They must not forget the fact that we are all interconnected The villagers who have become victims of the floods grow vegetables grains and all the raw material necessary to help sustain our lifestyles Rains and floodwater have destroyed hundreds of acres of standing crops and orchards If we delay our efforts in ensuring their relief and rehabilitation process we will have to pay the price for our lack of interest The price of food and other products will further increase Even higher inflation will bring down the whole nations quality of life We must help our unfortunate fellow citizens in their hour of need We must awaken our relatives and friends and start collecting relief goods for the flood affectees Media should also play and effective role like previous year Recommend

Dr Hasan Askari Rizvi It is understandable that security relationship between a superpower like the United States and a developing country like Pakistan can run into problems from time to time because their goals can not always be identical They work together on the basis of a shared goal and endeavour to expand the areas of convergence and reduce divergence The US and Pakistan share the goal of elimination of terrorism and stabilisation of the region However they diverge on the precise details of some strategies In the past they were able to deal with the differences through diplomatic interaction and especially through direct communication between their security establishments Periodically the US official circles publicly criticised Pakistans policies American and circles were more critical of Pakistan On the Pakistani side the official circles were very cautious in criticising the US they were often defensive in view of American official criticism Pakistans circles especially the Islamists were very critical of the US policies in the region The US and Pakistan were able get over the difficulties in their relations in the past What surprised everybody in Pakistan was the anger expressed in public by the US military top brass and the Defence Secretary at Pakistan after the Taliban attack in Kabul on September 13-14 2011 Their criticism was repeated by other top US officials including the Secretary of State and the spokesperson of the White House Short of declaring Pakistan a terrorist state US military and intelligence top bosses accused Pakistans security establishment of harbouring terrorism by supporting the Haqqani network that was waging war against American troops in Afghanistan One of the statements described the Haqqani group as the arm of the ISI American public denunciation of Pakistan has caused the gravest ever crisis in their relations since September 2001 Any deterioration of the relationship can cause a breakdown of their relationship The US needs Pakistans cooperation as long as American troops are based in Afghanistan in such a large number Pakistans support is also needed to stabilise Afghanistan Similarly Pakistan is not in favour of complete break up of the relationship because it is not in the interest of Pakistan to pick up direct confrontation with a superpower Pakistans troubled economic situation makes it imperative to maintain relations with the US and the Western world Further stabilisation of Afghanistan is as much in the interest of Pakistan as it is in the interest of the US If Pakistan and the US engage in confrontation peace and stability in and around Afghanistan will become obscure The first major crisis in 2011 developed on the Raymond Davis case against the backdrop of increased presence of US security contractors in Pakistan This was followed by the crisis in the aftermath of the Osama operation in Abbottabad which embarrassed Pakistan because its security authorities neither knew about the presence of Osama nor knew about the American security operation until it was almost over The latest crisis developed after the Taliban attack in Kabul because it embarrassed the US authorities in the domestic context the way Pakistan was embarrassed by the Raymond Davis arrest and release and the Osama operation The US military establishment decided to take on Pakistan either to convince its own public opinion that the security problems in Afghanistan are caused by the militant groups based in Pakistan or it wants to coerce Pakistan to send its troops into North Waziristan to address American security needs In theory the US can engage in aerial bombing of North Waziristan or send special forces for targeted operations or induct its troops for longer operation But in practice these are very hazardous strategies Any aerial bombing or induction of regular American troops in the tribal areas would rupture all interaction and cooperation between Pakistan and the US This will not serve the cause of eliminating terrorism As a matter of fact the Taliban other militant elements and Islamic groups based in Afghanistan and Pakistan will be the major beneficiary of this development This will strengthen these groups and radicalise Pakistan Any Pakistani civil government and the military will not be able to do any business with the US No American military and other supplies will be able to pass through Pakistan American military unilateralism in the tribal areas is dangerous for US goals in the region Destabilisation of Pakistan will be the direct consequence of American military adventurism in Pakistani territory without the guarantee that the US will be able to the Haqqani group and other militants It should have been obvious to American policy makers by now that Pakistan would not take military action in North Waziristan for a host of reasons that can not be discussed here for lack of space This policy will continue at least for the time being The US needs to tone down its rhetoric and adopt a approach to complex security problems in Afghanistan that require a balance between military and political strategies and cooperative action by the US Afghanistan and Pakistan rather than the US forcing a military strategy on Pakistan Pakistan needs a and approach towards terrorism In the short run Pakistan is justified in maintaining its autonomy in diplomatic and military domains and it should make it known once again that induction of American ground troops or aerial bombing by helicopters or regular military aircrafts will amount the crossing the red line in relations Pakistan needs to review its counterterrorism policies and examine the question why its security forces have not been able to establish their primacy in most tribal areas After expelling the militants from and South Waziristan in 2009 no such success has been reported from five tribal agencies where the security forces are constantly engaged in counter terrorism operations The people of the Kurram Agency can not travel directly to Peshawar because of Taliban activity They go there via Afghanistan How long this will continue Pakistan should establish state primacy in all tribal areas before the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan so that the possible Taliban onslaught from Afghanistan is effectively checked Even if some militant groups including the Haqqani group are not challenging Pakistan these will prove to be a liability if the Taliban get strong in Afghanistan after the exit of the allied troops The mainland militant groups will also be strengthened Pakistans leadership should recognise that no militant group can be viewed as a strategic asset Rather these are going to be a strategic liability for Pakistan 

Amjad Riaz It was the time when the subcontinent had cities with special distinctions that told them apart from other cities in the region The Moghuls normally set up their capital at Agra Lahore or Delhi Agra is famous for the fabulous marble structure that is indeed a treasure for anyone to visit Baber and his progenies unified the subcontinent in their respectively distinctive but grand styles of governance Later Delhi became the emblematic city of the imperial symbol in the twentieth century and that is when in 1947 the subcontinent was split in to two nations Before or even after the partition the city of Lahore was adroitly remembered for its celebrated university the outstanding colleges and its vibrant cultural life Pakistan inherited two mega cities of Karachi and Lahore A decade or so later Islamabad was developed as a model city which was a big feather in the cap for the new born nation But sixty four years after independence the cities no longer represent the aspirations of a nation which should have adhered to the principles of saving the precious heritage as well as give new meaning to the very soul reflecting sumptuousness of freedom and thought in these cities Though the concept of social evolution had been well understood and developed but it was in the nineteenth century that scientific discovery of evolution was made The policy to give emphasis on evolving creative cities and not just focus on infrastructural development is a laudable one But ground realities point towards a rapid and gradual deterioration of environment in the urban communities The cities are no longer being looked upon as places where people interact do business and socialise They have become the battling ground to settle the scores of something nobody knows anything about In big cities one can find just as big a war zone as anyone can envisage It is difficult to select the words to describe the maladies affecting the urban communities in this country It is indeed a drawback that provisions of efficient road network and other utilities have not yet been made available to a large majority of the hundred and eighty million people in the country In these circumstances efforts to nurture a creative environment in the cities and towns would be a Herculean task We need to move forward quickly to stem the rot that has already crept in to the bigger cities of the nation For creative energies to prosper a supportive environment for nurturing the same is a sine qua non A strong imagination helps as they say to bring an event We build cities to house people and that they become useful members of the community In terms the human resource is also an earnest contributor in the effort to further the cause of economic development leading to prosperity for all The other towns in the country look up to the bigger cities where social and economic life is projected to reflect as role model for others to follow The master plan for Islamabad was very conveniently abandoned in the eighties The blue area along the Jinnah Avenue was abruptly added This addition resulted in traffic congestion in a city where previously there were adequate roads available for the residential areas on the two sides of this now not so wide a boulevard as it was originally intended to be Traffic concentration further necessitated the creation of underpasses but the encroachment and destruction of green areas between sectors for building approach roads was not a wise decision This has resulted in altering the very openness of the city which was the hallmark of the model of the city Until recently the wide and beautiful avenues in the city the Mall and the main boulevard of Gulberg in Lahore have been catering well to the needs of rush hour traffic even after many decades of their construction The wide roads of Clifton and the Saddar area of Karachi were once washed every morning There used to be a feeling of freshness when one stepped out on to the vibrantly alive environment of these cities We must revive the image of the city as a place for people to appreciate the beauty and soul of its environment 

Pakistan is a nation of approximately 170 million people Before the partition of the subcontinent the people of Pakistan and India lived in one of the most populous regions of the world After the fall of the Mughal empire in the failed revolution of 1857 a fall that had begun years earlier but which was officially accomplished in this year the British empire started ruling the subcontinent As it has happened for centuries the ruling elite brings with it its own set of rules and regulations for the conquered land this same phenomenon repeated itself in the subcontinent The British due to their advancements in the field of science and technology started developing their new adopted homeland on the pattern of their own motherland Railway tracks were laid down to far flung areas with the aim of connecting the rulers with the general masses and to ease the primitive harshness of travelling to all corners of their new empire Buildings were erected all over the that were constructed utilizing the latest techniques adopted from Victorian architecture and all kinds of developmental work was carried out The British love for tea was also adopted by their subjects with the effect that even though tea plantations are a rarity in the subcontinent we are still one of the largest importers of tea the world over This tradition of adopting the hobbies and the habits of the Englishman also extended to the area of sports where the locals started playing and indulging in a sport that was historically foreign to this land cricket Thus we see that today the people of the consider cricket to be one of their most prized possessions and their favourite With the advent of the print and later the electronic media the world has become much smaller Today all the people of the world are more closely related to each other at least in the context of being able to stay in touch and interact than ever before As science and technology keeps going up a spiral of progress and innovation we see that our lives have become much more An event taking place in one corner of the globe can now be seen by an audience sitting millions of miles away with the delay of only a few seconds This global coverage of events has brought in the concept of where the audiences have increased to over millions of people Sporting events in general also attract huge numbers of audiences The advent of this electronic age has thus ushered in a new era in the context of sporting activities and events as well Where once celebrities were only local heroes now celebrities and sportsmen are a global phenomenon and brands in themselves What was once a foreign sport is now considered something that almost every Indian and Pakistani has a love for It is in this regard that Pepsi managed to outsmart Coke and thus became the choice drink for almost every Pakistani As was discussed earlier in this thesis that product placement is a form of subliminal marketing the case of Pepsi and Coke in the context of Pakistan clearly highlights and proves a number of theories to be true with regards to subliminal marketing and its effectiveness Imran Khan the Pakistani cricketer turned philanthropist turned politician made his debut for the Pakistan team on the 3rd of June in 1971 versus England in a test match Imran signalled the arrival of a of cricketers in the history of our country Before the arrival of Imran Khan the subcontinents major strength in the field of cricket was their solid batsmen and their accurate and talented spinners Imran ushered in the era of the lightning fast bowling A true tiger in body and mind Imran became an overnight sensation and his fame and popularity soared higher than that experienced by any other cricketer in the before him Wherever Imran went huge crowds followed his every step just to have a glance of their idol His looks his overall persona and the aura that surrounded him meant that he was the equivalent of a rock star in the eyes of the people of the subcontinent The love for the sport mixed with the admiration for the genuine fast bowler and batsman extraordinaire gave rise to the first truly global sporting icon from the subcontinent When Imran started to shine on the field and in the press somewhere deep within the marketing department at Pepsi there was a moment of inspiration and a sparkle in the eyes of an executive which led to the idea of Pepsi sponsoring Imran and hiring him for the purpose of their advertising campaigns As it would be later proved this turned out to be an absolutely genius idea on the part of Pepsi Firstly because the love for cricket in the subcontinent meant that everyone from an year old to people who were in their 70s or 80s would be targeted by such a marketing campaign owing to the popularity of Imran and the image that was associated with him and secondly because their rivals Coke had not capitalized on this opportunity as yet Placing their product with Imrans overall persona as a sportsman and a tiger on the field and off of it meant that even on a subliminal level people would respond to it in a very positive manner and their purchase decision when it came down to buying a would be massively affected by this decision What followed was decades of partnership between Pakistani cricket and Pepsi Pepsis advertisements from the late 70s and early 80s included Imran as their main protagonist and Pepsi being conveniently placed with his global persona From the point of view of subliminal marketing this was a rousing success because firstly it showed how the sales of a product could be increased drastically if it was placed correctly with a celebrity of Imrans stature and how such an association would be beneficial towards destroying all product competition in the long run When Wasim Akram came to the fore as the next generation of lightening fast bowlers Pepsi was quick to pounce on this opportunity aswell and hired Wasim for all their marketing campaigns and media promotions The result was that sales of Pepsi soared to great levels due to this strategic product placement and consumers subconsciously related Pepsi to being a drink that would give them an added dimension of being a tiger just like their favourite fast bowlers of the time This clearly proves the fact that product placement greatly helps towards increasing the sales of a product greater sales translate into greater profits and that since product placement is a form of subliminal marketing therefore subliminal marketing leads to the birth of a bias in the minds of the consumers for the respective product which therefore leads to a favourable purchase decision This case of Pepsi versus Coke in the context of the Pakistani market clearly highlights how subliminal marketing can be an effective tool towards increasing sales and profits Pepsi were shrewd enough to understand this phenomenon with relation to the Pakistani market and thus reaped the profits and still continue to do so Thus even though Coke outsells Pepsi the world over in Pakistan this is the complete opposite with Pepsi outselling Coke

An IOM team is today working with the Pakistan navy to deliver 1,000 shelter and item relief kits to families stranded in villages in the western Tando Bago area of Sindh Badin district The kits each containing two plastic tarpaulins two blankets a kitchen set and a bucket will be the first international assistance to reach the villages near Judho many of which have been cut off by flood waters since About 30kms east of Tando Bago town the road gets narrower and then disappears into a vast sea of water The marines are ferrying people to and from villages that have been cut off but no emergency shelter aid has reached them up to now says IOM Operations Officer Sher Sultan The operation which follows IOM distributions of some 2,500 tents and shelter kits in Badin over the past month will only meet a fraction of local shelter needs according to overwhelmed local government officials They believe that up to 1.7 million of the district 1.8 million residents have been affected by the floods the vast majority of them poor tenant farmers and their families In a government flood relief centre set up in a vocational training college in Badin 27-year-old tenant farmer Fida Hussain says that in his village in Nindo Shaher Union Council 35 kms from Badin all 200 houses are submerged in up to six feet of water together with 600 acres land The cotton rice sugar cane chili and tomato crops have all been destroyed by the floods and he expects to have to stay in the centre with 113 other families for two to three months before they can safely return home At a second government relief centre at another technical training college in Badin 50-year-old small landowner Muhammad Ghulam hopes that the 222 families from his community sheltering in the centre will be able to start returning home in a month or so Their adjacent villages in Gharo and Golarchi Union Councils also 35km from Badin are now submerged in up to five feet of flood water and most of the metal frame and wooden houses that replaced traditional mud huts have collapsed or sank in the mud together with the school and the mosque he says Their rice cotton and tomato crop was lost but 80 per cent of their cows water buffalos and sheep survived Some of the men took the livestock to dry ground to the east in Tharparkar district and when the water subsides they will return to the village he adds With nearly 90 per cent of Badin partially submerged by floodwaters displaced families sheltering in government relief centres represent less of a humanitarian challenge to the authorities and aid agencies than the thousands living in spontaneous settlements set up on roads or higher dry ground close to their often inaccessible villages Many families prefer to stay close to home rather than move into relief centres or camps even if they could reach them because they do want to mix with other communities We have to respect people beliefs but it makes getting aid to them much more difficult in terms of logistics says IOM Hyderabad Head of Office Arshad Rashid According to Pakistan National Disaster Management Authority NDMA over million people have now been affected by the flooding in all 23 districts in Sindh Nearly 1.5 million houses have been damaged or destroyed and over 716,000 individuals are now living in 3,079 relief camps The same number of displaced people may be living in unrecorded spontaneous settlements according to an independent rapid needs assessment Based on available data and the assessment of 2,547 temporary settlements completed nearly two weeks ago by IOM and partner agencies in the IASC Emergency Shelter Custer IOM is now appealing to international donors for US 14.6 million to procure and distribute emergency shelter and relief items to another 553,000 vulnerable people over the next three months The money will go towards providing shelter and relief items for the most vulnerable flood victims meeting the needs of displaced people in temporary settlements and relief camps tracking displacement building local capacity and coordinating the work of the Emergency Shelter Cluster says IOM Pakistan Chief of Mission Hassan Abdel Moneim Mostafa For more information on the work of the Emergency Shelter Cluster in the 2011 Pakistan floods please go to For free use of pictures copyright IOM please go to http For other information please contact Chris Lom in Sindh Tel Email clom Saleem Rehmat in Islamabad Tel Email srehmat For additional information Jemini Pandya Tel 41 22 717 9486 Mobile 41 79 217 33 74 Email jpandya Jumbe Omari Jumbe Tel 41 22 717 9405 Mobile 41 79 812 77 34 Email jjumbe ISDN Line 41 22 788 38 61

BACKGROUND Fresh flooding in southern Sindh has affected an additional one million people as the flood wave reaches the Indus Delta There are serious fears of epidemics with an increased incidence of water borne diseases including cholera skin infections malaria and dengue fever Urgent need to scale up response across flood affected areas particularly across Sindh and Punjab The relief response is far from sufficient to address the humanitarian situation and only a limited proportion of the population in need have received assistance 

BACKGROUND Urgent need to scale up assessment and response across flood affected areas particularly in Sindh and Punjab Increased incidence of water borne disease malaria and dengue fever Westerly weather disturbance combined with heavy monsoon rain on 21 and 22 July triggered flash floods and river floods in several parts of the country Monsoon rains continued across the country especially in Khyber Pakhtunkwa KPK and Balochistan triggering additional floods in the low lying areas of Punjab and Sindh Punjab and Sindh are the country agricultural bread basket 

Key Messages In April food prices stabilized after significant increases in recent months High prices remain a major problem for the poor Nominal rice price may soon approach the level observed in 2008 People affected by the flood last year are still recovering and continue to require emergency assistance Different agencies are still concerned over their food security conditions Recent conflict between government forces and insurgents has displaced thousands of people in the north western districts of Pakistan 

The research finds that the same meteorological event an abnormal Rossby wave sparked extreme heat and persistent wildfires in Russia as well as unusual downstream wind patterns that shifted rainfall in the Indian monsoon region and fueled heavy flooding in Pakistan Although the heat wave started before the floods both events attained maximum strength at approximately the same time the researchers found by analyzing satellite data generated by NASA instruments capable of measuring the land surface temperature precipitation intensity and wildfire activity 

The United Nations said the massive floods in Pakistan had affected 13.8 million people and eclipsed the scale of the devastating 2004 tsunami as anger mounted among Pakistani government and UN officials have appealed for more urgent relief efforts to cope with the worst floods in more than 80 years with President Asif Ali Zardari due to return home after a heavily criticised European entire Swat valley where Pakistan fought a major campaign to flush out Taliban insurgents last year was cut off at the weekend as were parts of the country breadbasket in Punjab and Sindh This disaster is worse than the tsunami the 2005 Pakistan earthquake and the Haiti earthquake Maurizio Giuliano a spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA said the 13.8 million affected outstripped the more than million hit by the 2005 earthquake million in the tsunami and the million affected by the Haiti United Nations estimates 1,600 people have died in Pakistan floods About 220,000 were killed by the December 26 2004 tsunami in Southeast Mogwanja the UN humanitarian coordinator in Pakistan called on relief operations to be massively scaled up Millions of people have suffered and still there is more rain and further losses are feared I appeal to the world to help us prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told donors including the United States have pledged tens of millions of dollars in aid but on the ground Islamic charities with suspected extremist links have been far more visible in the relief effort than the meteorological office forecast only scattered rain in the next 24 hours and said the intensity of monsoon showers was with floods sweeping south thousands of people are fleeing into cities to seek safety as heavy rains continued to lash the province of Sindh and water levels rose further in the swollen Indus Zardari has spent August in France and Britain courting massive criticism from the political opposition and intelligentsia for not returning at a time of national disaster One protester threw a shoe at him in United Nations estimated that up to 500,000 people are homeless and 1.4 million acres of agricultural land destroyed in central Punjab province but said damage was worst in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa spokesman Mr Giuliano said that even donkeys were being used to access parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa inaccessible by other means and warned that the risk of diseases in the Punjab district of Muzaffargarh issued a red alert and ordered people to evacuate as water entered the city from breaches in canals The situation is very serious We are totally helpless That why we asked people to move to a safer place local official Farasat Iqbal told overloaded army boat evacuating people in the Punjab town of Jampur capsized Sunday and 30 people are missing said a local least 14 people including three children were killed as flash floods destroyed homes in the the northwestern Hangu district In the lawless Khyber district on the Afghan border 150 houses were destroyed in AFP 

MACH Three persons including EDO Education Kachhi were killed and two others injured by flash flood in Bolan River near Mach some 70 km east of here on Friday Sources said that Executive District Officer Education Kachhi Bolan Babo Imdad Hussain along with other personnel arrived in Mach to hand over monthly salary of female teachers His vehicle was washed away by flash flood in Mach stream while returning back to Dhadar As a result he himself his brother Niaz and the driver Wilson Masih died on the spot Two other persons suffered serious injuries who were identified 

For the past two weeks Kaywall has spent 12 hours a day moving his family livestock from his inundated village to the small town of Pingrio in Sindh province in the south The goats are the only thing he has managed to save from raging waters which swept away his house and belongings Like many other flood victims he awaits help from Pakistan government My house was completely destroyed said the construction worker whose family is stranded The government has not done anything for us They are not around The scene being played out in many parts of Sindh was a troubling reminder of floods that ravaged much of Pakistan in late July and August last year Pakistan civilian leaders were slow to respond leaving the far more decisive military to take charge of rescue and relief efforts along with international aid agencies 

Some people were able to reach the one road that leads to Pingrio which is flooded in some sections and is surrounded by water on several sides Islamic charities step in Some 900 people have taken shelter there in tents run by an Islamic charity that also provided relief in last year floods Analysts say the government will lose even more credibility if charities tied to Islamist groups are seen as more helpful than the state We have enough food for people here but if more are coming in then we wo be able to feed them said Abdul Karim who runs the Islamic charity camp The 2010 floods killed about 2,000 people and made 11 million homeless in one of Pakistan worst natural disasters About 800,000 families remain without permanent shelter Victims of the new floods face uncertainty as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened The flood was over my head said Alam a 31-year-old tenant farmer with four children It came suddenly in the middle of the night while we were sleeping 

On Friday the United States announced an additional 25 million for flood relief in Pakistan taking its total contribution to 35 million At the same time a group banned by the United Nations Security Council for its links with the militant outfit believed to be behind the Mumbai Bombay attacks in India has some 3,000 volunteers working around the country and is operating nine medical camps he floods have claimed at least 1,600 lives displaced more than million people and affected as many as 12 million as waters spread from the countrys northwest through the of Punjab As far as Sindh home to Karachi the countrys financial hub river banks are main focus is toward central Punjab and Sindh now says of Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority Punjab is Pakistan agricultural hub where UN World Food Program officials estimate that 80 percent of the countrys food stock has been depleted About 70 villages in Sukkur area of Sindh have been flooded in the past 24 hours according to the Pakistan ChinooksHeavy rains are expected to continue in areas over the next 36 hours and are likely to hamper rescue efforts Indeed US military personnel waiting to fly Chinook helicopters to areas cut off by flooding in Swat were grounded because of stormy Ahmed Zeb a resident of Saidu Sharif in Swat told the Monitor that little aid has reached those residents of Upper Swat cut off by road after several bridges were swept away They need food aid desperately these are poor people who can not store food and will soon be starving she said in a phone deputy spokesman Yahya Mujahid told the Monitor his group welcomed US aid efforts Everyone should be digging in for humanitys sake and we shouldnt be politicizing the matter We arent reaching out with an agenda in mind The whole world should be putting in aid America or whoever else and we want everyone to contribute he said in a phone interview from Mianwali in response Scorn has been heaped upon President Asif Ali Zardari for not canceling his visit to Europe where he met with British Prime Minister David Cameron and plans to launch his sons political career at an event in Birmingham on for a political career mired in controversy Zardaris latest faux pas isnt likely to be his undoing says Badar Alam editor of Pakistans weekly Herald magazine It was a bad decision but hes been hated for 15 years and will continue to be hated says Alam adding that the Paksitani medias fixation upon Zardari has distracted from the leadership of Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani who has made an effort to be visible in the has also hit Kashmir in the Ladakh region where at least 60 people have been killed A similar number of deaths 63 has been reported in Kashmir

Pakistan floods last summer could have been predicted AGU Release No 1104 31 January 2011 For Immediate Release WASHINGTONFive days before intense monsoonal deluges unleashed vast floods across Pakistan last July computer models at a European center were giving clear indications that the downpours were imminent Now a new scientific study that retrospectively examines the raw data from these computer models has confirmed that if the information had been processed forecasters could have predicted extremely accurate rainfall totals 8-10 days beforehand The study also finds that the floods themselves could have been predicted if this data which originated from the European Centre for Weather Forecasting ECMWF had been processed and fed into a hydrological model which takes terrain into account The July floods killed thousands of people and tens of thousands of cattle and left large parts of Pakistan in shambles The waters displaced or disrupted the lives of an estimated 20 million people People do understand the powers of modern environmental prediction says Peter Webster a professor of earth and atmospheric science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and lead author of the new study This disaster could have been minimized and even the flooding could have been minimized If we were working with Pakistan they would have known to 10 days in advance that the floods were coming He and his colleagues report their findings in a paper accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters a journal of the American Geophysical Union The ECMWF a organization of 33 participating European countries does not give out weather forecasts and weather warnings to the general public or media notes ECMWF scientist Anna Ghelli ECMWF provides numerical forecasts to its member and states and they are responsible to prepare forecasts for the public and advise the authorities in their own countries We noticed that the signal was there five days in advance Ghelli recalls However the lack of a cooperating agreement between the forecasting center and Pakistan meant that these rainfall warnings did make it to the Pakistani people nor did Pakistan own meteorological agency forecast the flooding In their research the Georgia Tech meteorologists use data from the European center to analyze whether or not the rainfall was above average for Pakistan and if the huge surges in the Indus River would have been predictable if flood forecasters were monitoring the country They determine that while the rainfall total for 2010 was slightly above average for the region the July deluges were exceptionally rare with rainfall amounts exceeding 10 times the average daily monsoon rainfall They also find that if a flood forecasting model had been in place the floods would have been predicted in time to issue warnings As a result of processing the raw output from ECMWF models from before the Pakistani deluge the team achieves greater accuracy than the raw numerical forecasts alone provided Some weather stations in Pakistan recorded nearly a foot 30 centimeters of rainfall during the 4-day downpour The predictions by Webster and his colleagues came in slightly below those amounts at the same locations Webster says that processing raw data into weather forecasts and combining them with hydrological models is only half the work In order to have any effect the resulting flood forecasts must be successfully disseminated at the village level and local leaders must also understand them In nearby Bangladesh Webster spent five years creating a technique and organizing a cooperating agreement with the Georgia Institute of Technology ECMWF the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center and the government of Bangladesh When flooding occurred there several years ago warnings made possible by the forecasting pact not only averted loss of life but also saved residents as much as 450 per farm about the equivalent of an average annual salary in that country In a few weeks Webster will attend an international meeting of developing nations in Bangkok to build support for flood forecasting in Pakistan He says a forecasting system in Pakistan would cost a few million dollars to but as little as 100,000 a year once operational He hopes to convince the World Bank currently providing billion of financing to Pakistan to fund the project In Bangladesh Webster recalls an imam at a local mosque told him about how they discussed the flood forecasts each day in prayer This is the sort of local solution that Webster envisions for Pakistan as well The National Science Foundation funded this research Notes for Journalists As of the date of this press release the paper by Webster et al is still in press not yet published Journalists and

Haiti Chile Eyjafjallajokull 2010 was a year when catastrophic natural disasters felt in abundance and seemed to span the entire calendar year With the media focused on the dire conditions these disasters caused the devastating floods that swept across Pakistan from July through seemed to have garnered far less attention Photographer Daniel Berehulak was there for much of it shooting coverage of a disaster that killed an estimated 1,700 affected more than 20 million and at one point left of the country underwater

The wide scale damage caused by the July floods in Pakistan and the staggering loss of life from the Haiti Earthquake earlier this year are a stark reminder of how a single disaster can set back development programs by years and perhaps decades The International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction on 13 October is an opportunity to focus attention on the work that is and can be done to make communities around the world safer from disasters The earthquake that struck in January showed just how dangerous a large disaster in an urban area 

Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd today announced a further 40 million in Australian Government aid to Pakistan Minister Rudd made the announcement while touring the province of Punjab the flood damage has left more than six million people dependent on emergency food supplies and up to ten million people without shelter It is estimated more than 21 million people are affected by the flooding which is more than the combined impacts of the 2004 Asian tsunami the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake crisis is already serious and further

The torrential rains and subsequent floods in Pakistan during current monsoon starting late July 2010 which caused deaths of over 1700 people destruction of residential buildings schools health facilities in thousands and devastation of agriculture sector also displaced scores of media professionals across the country Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists has reported damage to the properties a displacement of over 230 media professionals all the four provinces of Pakistan but Pakistan Press Foundations survey suggest that the number of such media professionals is higher than it The PPF survey which covers print as well as electronic media personnel and their organizations still continues however the initial data shows that a few media organizations sustained certain losses but the media professionals were the worst sufferers None of the private TV channels sustained any loss in heavy rains and floods being situated in urban areas especially in big cities while only few FM radio stations had to suspend transmissions due to floods that also in Punjab and Sindh provinces According to survey the FM radio in Layyah town in Southern Punjab had to suspend transmission for a few days while radio located in marooned city of Jacobabad a district headquarter town in northwest of Sindh province bordering Balochistan province stopped transmission after its equipment caught fire in heavy rains and later the entire staff fled to other areas to escape the floods located in Dadu city about 350km north of Karachi also stopped transmission a month back after rainwater flooded its small building The owners told that its transmission tower had also collapsed in winds and heavy rains In eastern district Sanghar bordering India the radio also suspended transmission for three days due to heavy rains In Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa province the FM radio located in Dera Ismail Khan had to suspend its transmission for a week due to intense humidity caused by the heavy rains Its transmissions were also disrupted by power outages In Charsadda town the itself did not suffer any loss but its staff became displaced and reportedly four radio journalists became homeless as the torrential rains destroyed their houses It is reported that a large number of media professionals in KP province had to leave their homes and take refuge at safer places Their details are being collected In Balochistan province the journalists stationed at Jaffarabad Osta Muhammad and some other towns bordering Sindh province were also displaced after the River Indus water inundated a considerable area after devastating northern Sindh districts The number of journalists representing print and electronic media in these towns varies from 20 to 50 and according to survey all these had to shift along with their families to Quetta the capital of Balochistan and other towns or to some towns of Sindh In Sindh province Parts of district Ghotki entire Jacobabad district and southern district Thatta were the most affected districts from where a large number of media professionals are displaced Around 150 journalists of Jacobabad district had to leave their homes and take refuge in other towns of province The journalists of too had to vacate homes and shift to other towns like other citizens while around 100 media persons of Thatta left their homes for taking refuge in other areas after a breach in River Indus bank Later they returned to homes after a week when the floodwater was diverted to other area Some of them own agricultural lands which were destroyed by floods It is estimated that over 400 media professionals are displaced in these few districts of Sindh alone Since the floods are not yet over most of them could not be contacted being still displaced The latest reports received on Thursday September 02 2010 from Jati a Taluka headquarter and last southern coastal town of Thatta district suggest that the town had 20 journalists of whom 16 have left the homes along with 95 percent other population to safer places after the floodwater started entering its limits Only four media professionals chose to stay in town to perform duties They too however have shifted their families to safer places Latest information says that administration has advised citizens to vacate the Khairpur Nathan Shah town of Dadu district as the floodwater is least 20 newsmen would be displaced due to this situation 

The research finds that the same meteorological event an abnormal Rossby wave sparked extreme heat and persistent wildfires in Russia as well as unusual downstream wind patterns that shifted rainfall in the Indian monsoon region and fueled heavy flooding in Pakistan Although the heat wave started before the floods both events attained maximum strength at approximately the same time the researchers found by analyzing satellite data generated by NASA instruments capable of measuring the land surface temperature precipitation intensity and wildfire activity William Lau and Kim atmospheric scientists at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt authored the study which the Journal of Hydrometeorology published in August A Rossby Connection The atmosphere gaseous and transparent may not seem like a fluid but that precisely how the thin layer of air encasing the planet behaves As Earth spins on its axis huge rivers of air scientists call them Rossby waves meander around the globe in a westerly direction Currents in the center of these waves form the jet streams columns of air that push weather systems from west to east Rossby waves are uniform They tend to undulate and have troughs and ridges Areas of typically develop in the troughs of the waves while areas form in their ridges Parcels of warm air from the tropics and cool air from the poles swirl around the and parts of the waves creating a complex tapestry of warm and cool fronts that meet and interact constantly Collisions between warm and cool fronts produce storms and precipitation Under normal summertime conditions the jet stream pushes weather fronts through Eurasia in four or five days but something unusual happened in July of 2010 A stagnant weather pattern known as an Omega blocking event developed over a ridge above western Russia This blocking event which divided the jet stream had the effect of slowing the Rossby wave and prevented the normal progression of weather systems from west to east As a result a large region of high pressure formed over Russia and trapped a hot dry air mass As the high lingered the land surface dried and the normal transfer of moisture from the soil to the atmosphere slowed Precipitation ceased vegetation dried out and the region became a taiga tinderbox Meanwhile the blocking pattern created unusual downstream wind patterns over Pakistan Areas of low pressure on the leading edge of the Rossby wave formed in response to the high that pulled cold dry Siberian air into lower latitudes From NASA satellite data and wind analysis we can clearly see the connection between the two events Lau said Think of the atmosphere like a loose membrane If you push one part up something else has to come down somewhere else If you produce a high in one region you produce a corresponding low in another This cold air from Siberia clashed with warm moist air arriving over Pakistan from the Bay of Bengal There nothing unusual about moisture moving north over India toward the Himalayas It a normal part of the monsoon However in this case the unusual wind patterns associated with the blocking high brought upper level air disturbances farther south than is typical which helped shift the entire monsoon rainfall system north and west The shift brought heavy monsoon rains squarely over the northern part of Pakistan Future Directions While the new study highlights the degree of interconnection that can exist between two seemingly unrelated weather events Lau cautions that many questions remain For example why did such a powerful blocking high form in the first place And did some particular process occurring on the land or in the atmosphere sustain and strengthen it Lau analysis of data from the Modern Era for Research and Applications MERRA an atmospheric model focused on hydrology that blends data from satellites and the Goddard Earth Observing System Model Version suggests that certain interactions between the land and atmosphere may have amplified the heat wave as it dragged on creating what climatologists call a positive feedback cycle Clouds for example typically provide shade and precipitation but Lau research shows they were suppressed in the vicinity of the blocking high because prolonged drought dried the soil and slowed the rate of evaporation The modeling and satellite data suggest that over time the reduced cloud cover would have resulted in an even greater dose of heat reaching the surface which in turn would have dried the soil out even more and amplified the effect What more Lau thinks that dark particles in wildfire smoke a type of aerosol called black carbon may have helped burn clouds away making the surface even drier and more fire prone We need more research to say for sure whether land and aerosol feedback sustained the high but this study suggests it possible said Ralph Kahn an atmospheric scientist at Goddard who was involved in the study Recommend this story on Facebook Twitter and Google

Instability and Aid The destruction could set Pakistan back many years if not decades further weaken its feeble civilian administration and add to the burdens on its military The floods in Pakistan have upended the Obama administration carefully honed strategy in a country that was already one of its thorniest problems Pakistan is a central pillar of American regional strategy to combat the Taliban and Al Qaeda but also a place long troubled by a weak government and economic woes Islamic groups stepped in to provide aid where the government has failed to reach the United States also sent aid with an eye to improving its reputation among ordinary Pakistanis The Pakistani government and the military were engaged in a campaign to restore public services in Pakistans northwest trying to rebuild trust after more than two million people were displaced in 2009 when government forces launched a major offensive against militants But the reconstruction efforts were painfully slow and the public mood shifted from frustrated to furious The country infrastructure was devastated by the floods More than 5,000 miles of roads and railways were washed away along with some 7,000 schools and more than 400 health facilities Close to 1.7 billion has been pledged for Pakistan but less than 300 million came from private donors The United States government pledged almost of the total The World Bank pledged to reroute money from other projects to provide 900 million in emergency funds to help recovery efforts The United Nations secretary general Ban who flew over the country on August 15 with President Asif Ali Zardari said he had never seen such a disaster and urged foreign donors to speed up their assistance President Zardari who came under stinging criticism for making a trip to Europe as the flood disaster unfolded made his first tour of areas on August 12 At Risk for Disease United Nations officials said that a shortage of aid funds left some six million people the majority of them children and infants at risk of potentially lethal diseases borne by dirty water Aid workers confirmed the first reports of cholera in the Swat Valley of the northwestern Province and in the remote Rajanpur district in Punjab Province Cholera is common in South Asia during the rainy season but flooding that overflows outhouses and sewage canals compounds the problem The authorities ability to contain the disease depends on whether they can get antibiotics to people who are ill and clean water to people who are not Food Shortage Fears Even as the government and international relief workers struggle to get food and clean water to millions of Pakistanis concerns are growing about the enduring toll of the disaster on the nations overall economy food supply and political stability Providing clean water for millions and avoiding the spread of diseases like cholera are the first priorities But there are also looming food shortages and price spikes even in cities There is also the danger that farmers will miss the fall planting season raising the prospect of a new cycle of shortfalls next year The prospect of immediate hunger combining with disruptions to food supplies was a chief concern The floods submerged about 17 million acres of Pakistans most fertile croplands in a nation where farming is an economic mainstay The waters have also killed more than 200,000 head of livestock and washed away large quantities of stored commodities that feed millions throughout the year While dire conditions threaten rural communities severe inflation and shortages of fresh produce loom for even large urban centers relatively unaffected by the floods like Karachi Hide 

OSLO Reuters Devastating floods in Pakistan and Russia heatwave match predictions of extremes caused by global warming even though it is impossible to blame mankind for single severe weather events scientists say This year is on track to be the warmest since reliable temperature records began in the century beating 1998 mainly due to a of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels according to the World Meteorological Organization WMO We will always have climate extremes But it looks like climate change is exacerbating the intensity of the extremes said Omar Baddour chief of climate data management applications at WMO headquarters in Geneva It is too early to point to a human fingerprint behind individual weather events he extremes include mudslides in China and heat records from Finland to Kuwait adding to evidence of a changing climate even as negotiations on a new global treaty for costly cuts in greenhouse gas emissions have Munich Re said a natural catastrophe database it runs shows that the number of extreme weather events like windstorm and floods has tripled since 1980 and the trend is expected to persist The worst floods in Pakistan in 80 years have killed more than 1,600 people and left million homeless Global warming is one reason for the rare spate of weather extremes said Gerstengarbe a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact pointed to the heatwave and related forest fires in Russia floods in Pakistan rains in China and downpours in countries including Germany and Poland We have four such extremes in the last few weeks This is very seldom he weather extremes and the chance of a 2010 undercut a view of skeptics that the world is merely witnessing natural swings perhaps caused by variations in the sun worst drought in decades has led to fires that have almost doubled death rates in Moscow to around 700 per day an official said Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced a grain export ban from August 15 to December 31.Nearly 1,500 people have died in landslides and flooding caused by months of torrential rains across China the Ministry of Civil Affairs said one cause of a shift in monsoon rains in Asia seemed to be a effect of La Nina a natural cooling of the Pacific say it is impossible to pin the blame for individual events from hurricanes to sandstorms solely on human activities led by burning of fossil fuels that release carbon one study concluded that global warming had doubled the chances of heatwaves similar to a scorching 2003 summer in Europe in which 35,000 people died Those temperatures could not convincingly be explained by natural variations It may be possible to use climate models to determine whether human influences have changed the likelihood of certain types of extreme events the panel of climate scientists said in its latest 2007 report said it was at least 90 percent likely that most warming in the past 50 years was caused by mankind a finding questioned by skeptics who have pointed to errors in the report such as an exaggeration of the melt of Himalayan glaciers Warming of the climate is likely to bring more events of this sort said Henning Rodhe professor emeritus of chemical meteorology at Stockholm University of the Russian heatwave But you ca draw the conclusion that this is caused by global warming Most countries agreed at a climate summit in Copenhagen last year to limit a rise in average world temperatures to below degrees Celsius above times a tough goal since temperatures already rose 0.7C in the 20th latest round of climate talks in Bonn from August 2-6 ended with growing doubts that a global climate treaty could still be agreed as hoped by some nations in 2010 despite deep splits about sharing the burden of curbs on Senate majority leader Harry Reid has all but abandoned climate change legislation this year The United States the number two greenhouse gas emitter behind China is the only major industrialized nation with no law to cut emissions 

Severe flooding in Pakistan It is only the start of the monsoon season but already Pakistan is experiencing some of the worst flooding it has seen in over 80 years Entire villages have been washed away an early estimate of over 1,600 deaths so far and over million displaced or otherwise affected Not only is the immediate water damage causing havoc the floods have inundated areas dealing a crippling blow to the economy and threatening a food crisis The Pakistani government now struggles to rescue and provide aid to millions while still fighting with militant Islamist forces in many of

Pakistani villagers carry their belongings through flood water following heavy monsoon rain at Golarchi town in Badin district about 200 km east of Karachi on September 13 2011 Photo Asif Hassan AFP Getty Images These days when it rains in South Asia it does just pour it floods A month of monsoon squalls has deluged hundreds of towns and villages in northwest India and Pakistan The latter has seen the most acute flooding and on all evidence has been the least prepared for it At least 233 people have already died and 300,000 are now stranded or in makeshift camps a figure that will surely grow Officials in Pakistan claim some 5.5 million people so far have been affected by rising waters That still only a fraction of the 20 million hit by last year catastrophic rains but the forecast looks ominous Neva Khan Oxfam Pakistan country director spelled out the dimensions of the crisis on the relief agency website There is an urgent need to provide immediate and life saving relief to the millions affected It has stopped raining in Sindh for the last 10 days Large swathes of land are underwater and people are desperately awaiting relief They have lost their crops homes and livestock for the second time and been pushed from last year disaster to this one Sindh the vast fertile province abutting the Arabian Sea appears the worst affected Across Pakistan some 900 villages have been wholly submerged and millions of hectares of arable land some still irrevocably damaged by last year floods are under water What most depressing about the situation now is how keenly it echoes the 2010 calamity Omar Waraich TIME Islamabad correspondent wrote this excellent piece a year ago for the magazine international editions As the waters rise Pakistan faces a familiar cocktail of maladies from last summer Then the civilian government headed by the unpopular President Asif Zardari was hampered by political infighting and its fundamental subservience to the real power of Pakistan influential military Now not much has changed though Zardari is still in his position a surprise to some Then militants and terrorists were exposing the fragility of the Pakistani state with strikes on some of country major cities Now after a rancorous summer of with the not much has changed either not least when suspected allied militants raided a prominent naval base in Karachi earlier this year Then the government pleaded for foreign assistance Now similar calls are being issued with similar notes of desperation In the weeks to come inquests will be made into whether enough had been done to shore up riverbanks provide shelter and food for the hundreds of thousands left destitute for over a year and prepare for the next season rains Already there are reports of angry civilians blockading roads like last year demanding outside intervention and aid Cities like Karachi which this summer has seen a spasm of internecine will be further strained by refugees fleeing the countryside On many levels though the disaster is not The floodplain of the great Indus river home to over 100 million people birthed one of the world first ancient civilizations But the river likely also swallowed it up Because of its own particular ecology the Indus ca be controlled by similar mechanisms of levees prevalent in the West And climate change has made weather patterns more unpredictable and BBC story from a year ago cites the research of an Indian scientist Professor Rajiv Sinha from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur who has had first hand experience of Asian river floods takes a more strident position What all the climate models predict is that the distribution of monsoon rains will become more uneven in the future he told BBC News Total rainfall stays the same but it comes in shorter more intense bursts In August 2010 more than half of the normal monsoon rain fell in only one week Typically it is spread over three months Professor Sinha remarked Rivers just ca cope with all that water in such a short time It was five times maybe 10 times more than normal So if the unusually intense 2010 monsoon is the shape of things to come and that is uncertain the future may hold more flood misery for the people of Pakistan It a closing sentence that has proven sadly prophetic

Extreme weather With what we know about climate change it is a sad fact that for Oxfam the floods in Pakistan were not a massive surprise This is not the same as saying this particular flood is due to climate change the worlds atmosphere is so complex that it is currently impossible to draw such direct concrete conclusions However as Oxfam research in three regions of Pakistan shows people there are suffering more intense and heavier rainfall in coastal areas more intense cyclones more intense flooding in areas along the Indus and more pronounced droughts in the arid areas of Khuzdar It is this flooding along the Indus that is causing such massive upheaval now This trend of more frequent more intense weather patterns and the increased suffering it brings is a global phenomenon Oxfams Right to Survive report indicates that we can expect the number of people being affected by climate related disasters to rise by 50 per cent from 250 million people in 2010 to 375 million people in 2015 And thats why as we react to the immediate needs of people suffering today and this week we need to help the people rebuild in a way that will build in future resilience to the more intense more frequent climatic disasters that are expected in the future Update July 2011 

Unusually heavy monsoon rains in July and August 2010 left large swaths of Pakistan underwater At least 18 million people were affected by the flood and it is estimated that more than six months later several hundred thousand remain without even temporary shelter As a result of lost crops and livelihoods from the flood and inadequate relief supplies malnutrition continues to kill people Like most floods the Pakistani poor have suffered far more than those with resources to avoid the flood or at least its aftermath Remains of a school destroyed by flooding near Jacobabad by UK Department for International Development on Flickr Used under a Creative Commons license A paper in press in Geophysical Research Letters shows that the 2010 floods were extraordinary Monsoonal rains tend to occur in pulses with wet periods followed by dry periods and while the total rainfall over Pakistan during the 2010 monsoon season was not unprecedented the number and intensity of extremely heavy rains over northern Pakistan was very unusual The authors are working with very limited historical and satellite data but they estimate that the number of intense rain bursts that occurred in 2010 had a probability of less than in any given year Using data from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts collection of meteorological models the authors of the new paper show that the timing and intensity of northern Pakistans monsoon rain bursts are predictable up to to days in advance including the rains that caused the flooding in 2010 Lead author Peter Webster and his coauthors from the Georgia Institute of Technology draw the following conclusion from their analysis We conclude that if these extended quantitative precipitation forecasts had been available in Pakistan the high risk of flooding could have been foreseen If these rainfall forecasts had been coupled to a hydrological model then the high risk of extensive and prolonged flooding could have anticipated and actions taken to mitigate their impact The floods really kicked off with a burst of rain on 28-29 July 2010 and according to Websters reanalysis that rainfall was predictable with good skill days in advance 21 July Webster and colleagues argue that if that forecast was available in Pakistan lives would have been saved and the immensity of the disaster reduced But Christine Fair writing on the Foreign Policy magazine website suggests that the flood was forecast in Pakistan In the middle of July the PMD began tracking a storm brewing in the Bay of Bengal This eastern weather system developed interactively with a western weather system to produce the massive rains and the subsequent super flood of 2010 On July 24 the PMD issued a flood warning to the provincial government of KPK Despite these increasingly severe warnings KPKs citizenry did not believe them The PMD kept issuing warnings to KPK as the rains began to fall However as fate would have it on July 28 a passenger jet coming to Islamabad from Karachi crashed With the media beset upon this tragic spectacle the PMDs warnings went unheeded as the rain began to fall So the Pakistani government did forecast the flood at least four days out in plenty of time to get people in northern Pakistans valleys out of the way The problem was not with the meteorological and hydrologic science either internationally or in Pakistan Instead disaster was ensured when flood warnings were not taken sufficiently seriously by regional authorities media and residents Why wouldnt flood warnings be heeded Perhaps more could have been done to communicate to Pakistanis through channels whose authority they respected Webster cites an example of flood warnings in Bangladesh being disseminated by imams at local mosques The Foreign Policy article quoted above places some blame on media distractedness But there was also a more insidious reason the forecasted flood was ignored It was a rare event but it was also part of a new climatic pattern for Pakistan As the Foreign Policy article describes it in recent years there has been a slow but steady change in the location where Pakistans major rainfalls concentrate In the past monsoon rains fell most intensely over the Punjab Slowly and steadily the concentration of rainfall has moved north and west to KPK This redistribution of concentrated rainfall away from the Punjab and towards KPK explains why no one in KPK had any reason to believe the predicted weather Flooding frequency and intensity have increased in Pakistan in the last 30-40 years compared to earlier in the 20th century Webster and coauthors state This recent increase is consistent with the increase in intensity of the global monsoon accompanying the last three decades of general global warming The flood warnings were ignored in part because the statistics of monsoon rain patterns are changing Human memory and historical records are not good guidance if the weather system is changing In situations like this one the past is not the key to the present There are lots of things that should have been improved to lessen the magnitude of the Pakistani flood disaster reservoir management should have been altered emergency relief supplies should have been distributed more equitably broadly and consistently international assistance should have been much more generous but the two big lessons for hazard mitigation coming out of the Pakistan floods seem to be find a system for making sure that warnings are issued and that they actually make it to people in harms way and dont assume the climate of living memory is a very good indicator of the weather of the present and future Webster Toma Kim 2011 Were the 2010 Pakistan floods predictable Geophysical Research Letters

At least 5.3 million people have been affected by this years monsoonal flooding in Pakistan and the situation is expected to worsen quickly More than 4.2 million acres of land have been flooded in the southern province of Sindh and 1.6 million acres of standing crops have been destroyed It hasnt stopped raining in Sindh for the last 10 days says Neva Khan Country Director of Oxfam in Pakistan Large swathes of land are underwater and people are desperately awaiting relief They have lost their crops homes and livestock for the second time and been pushed from last years disaster to this one What Oxfam is doing Oxfam has launched an emergency response to assist those affected by the floods Were already delivering clean water to two of the hardest hit areas of Sindh province and well be scaling up to supply clean water and sanitation supplies to nearly 850,000 people Were also carrying out rescue operations in several areas In addition well be helping people get access to food and were developing projects to help people earn a living Were also calling on international donors to dig deep and respond to the urgent needs of the women men and children affected by this disaster The crisis is multiplying each passing day The international community needs to expedite its response to ensure that millions affected get the help they need as soon as possible said Neva Khan A country unprepared In a recent report Oxfam called on the government of Pakistan to do more to protect its people from disasters such as these For example river embankments in Sindh province have reportedly been increased by only two or three feet after last years floods rather than the recommended six feet Were asking the Pakistan government and international donors to invest more in measures to reduce the impact of disasters such as housing and effective early warning systems 

If data from the European weather center had been properly analyzed Pakistan could have been warned more than a week ahead of the calamity an independent expert is now saying There was 80 percent probability of severe rain eight to nine days out said Peter Webster of the Georgia Institute of Technology who examined the European center data Webster will publish his analysis which he performed months after the floods in an upcoming issue of Geophysical Research Letters 

The head of Pakistan weather service said that his agency did forecast heavy rains four day ahead of the deluge in part by using the European data But the agency missed on predicting that the rain would be so extreme said Arif Mahmood director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department in an interview from Islamabad Never in memory had the summer monsoons that soak much of South Asia veered so far west

What going on in these pictures is incredible It seems that the waters from last year floods in Pakistan forced millions of spiders into these trees creating these impressive images according to the UK Department For International Development DFID Apparently the water took so long to recede that the spiders eventually turned the trees into cocoons While the DFID has been doing its part to help the flood survivors recover including providing clean drinking water medical support and food the spiders seem to be doing their part as well They may be reducing the spread of malaria According to Wired and the DFID the spiders massive webs are likely capturing mosquitos thus preventing the disease from spreading While the webs may have created an erie landscape the areas in which they appear seem to have significantly fewer dangerous mosquitos than expected To find out more about how aid from the UK government is helping survivors in Pakistan return home and rebuild their lives click here 

An unexpected of the flooding in parts of Pakistan has been that millions of spiders climbed up into the trees to escape the rising flood waters Because of the scale of the flooding and the fact that the water has taken so long to recede many trees have become cocooned in spiders webs As a result the mosquito population seems to have decreased a small blessing likely caused by these webs

For the past two weeks Kaywall has spent 12 hours a day moving his family livestock from his inundated village to the small town of Pingrio in Sindh province in the south The goats are the only thing he has managed to save from raging waters which swept away his house and belongings Like many other flood victims he awaits help from Pakistan government My house was completely destroyed said the construction worker whose family is stranded The government has not done anything for us They are not around The scene being played out in many parts of Sindh was a troubling reminder of floods that ravaged much of Pakistan in late July and August last year Pakistan civilian leaders were slow to respond leaving the far more decisive military to take charge of rescue and relief efforts along with international aid agencies 

Some people were able to reach the one road that leads to Pingrio which is flooded in some sections and is surrounded by water on several sides Islamic charities step in Some 900 people have taken shelter there in tents run by an Islamic charity that also provided relief in last year floods Analysts say the government will lose even more credibility if charities tied to Islamist groups are seen as more helpful than the state We have enough food for people here but if more are coming in then we wo be able to feed them said Abdul Karim who runs the Islamic charity camp The 2010 floods killed about 2,000 people and made 11 million homeless in one of Pakistan worst natural disasters About 800,000 families remain without permanent shelter Victims of the new floods face uncertainty as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened The flood was over my head said Alam a 31-year-old tenant farmer with four children It came suddenly in the middle of the night while we were sleeping

Pakistan 2010 floods were the countrys worst in recorded history They killed more than 2,000 people and affected 18 million more than a tenth of the population A massive cascade of waters triggered by heavy monsoon rains in late July swept through the Indus River basin washing away homes roads bridges crops and livestock It ploughed a swathe of destruction from north to south and submerged of the country The flooding devastated parts of northwest province which saw some of the fiercest fighting in Pakistan war against Taliban insurgents People in the Swat Valley who had been trying to rebuild their lives following a massive military operation against the Taliban in 2009 were particularly badly affected The southern Punjab and Sindh provinces where the majority of Pakistanis live were also badly affected An estimated 11 million people were made homeless by the disaster The floods destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of cultivatable land and crops in the traditional regions of Sindh and Punjab and many farmers lost their seeds In some areas the water stagnated on the surface for months making planting difficult And at least 1.2 million livestock died crippling poor families who depended on them for food and draught power the Food and Agriculture Organisation said The price of vegetables and other foods rose making it harder for ordinary people to survive The country suffered more than 10 billion in damages to infrastructure irrigation systems bridges houses and roads SLOW AID The authorities and aid agencies struggled to help the survivors many of whom lost everything and said they received no warnings that raging waters were heading their way Many were forced to live in wretched conditions beside roads sleeping in the open with little food or clean water Fears of a second wave of deaths caused by and diseases such as cholera typhoid and malaria eased as the floodwaters receded Aid organisations and the government were criticised for being too slow to respond while the military the most powerful institution in Pakistan took the lead in relief operations With the government overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster charities linked to Islamist militants were quick to step in with help Pakistan promised to clamp down on these charities amid fears their involvement in flood relief would undermine the fight against groups like the Taliban The United Nations issued an appeal for 460 million in August Speaking at a special meeting on 19 Ban called the crisis one of the greatest tests of global solidarity in our times Major donors included the United States which gives billions of dollars in military aid to help Islamabad fight Taliban and al Qaeda fighters along the Afghan border Britain and the European Union However donors concerns about the countrys widespread corruption and lack of transparency slowed disbursal of funds 2011 FLOODS Pakistan was woefully unprepared for the 2011 monsoon season All along the Indus River dikes and embankments are incomplete while international donations for preparedness fell short Sindh is especially vulnerable to new flooding Although a repeat of the 2010 deluge is unlikely even smaller floods could cause millions of dollars in damages and set back reconstruction efforts experts said The head of the emergencies office OCHA in Pakistan Manuel Bessler warned in June 2011 that floods are likely to affect million people although that figure could rise to million if the monsoons are heavier than expected The United Nations said it has been working hard to stockpile food water and tents in case of more floods this year Pakistans monsoon season lasts until the first week of September

The Infectious Disease Risk document attached is intended to estimate disease risks in relief personnel who are living in austere field conditions including exposure to locally procured food and untreated water Risks are quoted in the absence of countermeasures such as medication bednets insect repellent vaccinations etc The document is not intended to reflect the infectious disease risks of the indigenous population and does not include many routine essentially ubiquitous illnesses such as upper respiratory infections and skin infections 

Reaching the most vulnerable In response to the fresh flooding UNICEF is urgently delivering vital emergency supplies including hundreds of thousands of litres of clean water daily so children do get sick from contaminated flood water 

WASHINGTON For the last six months Handicap International 500-strong team has supported people stricken by the flooding that has devastated Pakistan affecting 20 million people and damaging 1.7 million homes The organization is implementing a program focused on improving access to drinking water and sanitation and distributing emergency aid to meet the basic needs of the victims who have largely been forgotten Six months after the floods began the situation remains very serious 20 million people have been affected Currently 

Montral 10 August 2010 Handicap International has been providing relief to the victims of the current flooding in Pakistan for almost a week The water distribution and activities set up by the organisation immediately after the start of the floods are continuing The distribution of hygiene kits is also gradually being expanded According to the United Nations almost 14 million people are expected to be affected by the flooding the worst since 1929 The situation in Pakistan has seriously deteriorated over the last week with heavy rainfall worsening the flooding 

The teams are seeing first hand today the devastation and vast amount of flood water in Sindh Pakkala rains during the annual monsoon season have inundated an estimated 4.2 million acres of land the said 

In the span of three month HHRD relief efforts benefited over 500,000 flood victims Established over 550 free medical camps Conducted 10 hygiene awareness sessions Distributed food packs that benefited over 371,000 Provided cooked meals to hundreds of starving families Provided tents and other emergency supplies to thousands relief program launched with the adoption of union councils 

HHRD Flood Response Highlights HHRD continues providing relief to hundreds of thousands of flood survivors in Pakistan To date HHRD relief efforts benefited 153,000 flood victims Hygiene promotion provision of safe drinking water activities are underway in 275 medical camps provided free consultation medication to over 54,000 flood victims 96,000 received food package 

On 28 july 2010 In Pakistan heavy rainfall caused floods in different small rivers and water passages Particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa District Nowshehra Peshawar Charsadda Swat Dir lower bannu kohat lucki Marwat shangla and Battgram In Punjab district Rajin Pur are the areas where emergency has been declared due to floods and in Baluchistan district Barkhan Sibi Kohlo Bolan and Naseerabad are the flood affected districts These devastating floods caused more then 250 causalities misplaced thousands of families and damaged physical infrastructure in the affected areas 

For the past two weeks Kaywall has spent 12 hours a day moving his family livestock from his inundated village to the small town of Pingrio in Sindh province in the south The goats are the only thing he has managed to save from raging waters which swept away his house and belongings Like many other flood victims he awaits help from Pakistan government My house was completely destroyed said the construction worker whose family is stranded The government has not done anything for us They are not around The scene being played out in many parts of Sindh was a troubling reminder of floods that ravaged much of Pakistan in late July and August last year Pakistan civilian leaders were slow to respond leaving the far more decisive military to take charge of rescue and relief efforts along with international aid agencies 

Some people were able to reach the one road that leads to Pingrio which is flooded in some sections and is surrounded by water on several sides Islamic charities step in Some 900 people have taken shelter there in tents run by an Islamic charity that also provided relief in last year floods Analysts say the government will lose even more credibility if charities tied to Islamist groups are seen as more helpful than the state We have enough food for people here but if more are coming in then we wo be able to feed them said Abdul Karim who runs the Islamic charity camp The 2010 floods killed about 2,000 people and made 11 million homeless in one of Pakistan worst natural disasters About 800,000 families remain without permanent shelter Victims of the new floods face uncertainty as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened The flood was over my head said Alam a 31-year-old tenant farmer with four children It came suddenly in the middle of the night while we were sleeping 

As the Disasters Emergency Committee launches an emergency appeal to raise funds for victims of the devastating floods in Pakistan British charities are scrambling to get aid to the worst affected regions The UN says Pakistan worst flooding in nearly a century has now affected more than four million people and left at least 1,600 dead Charities have been quick to send supplies and emergency response teams But with fresh flood warnings and more rain forecast and thousands struggling with shortages of food clean water shelter and medicine UK aid agencies say the situation on the ground is desperate Patrick Fuller from the British Red Cross has been based in Islamabad for the past few days and visited many of the provinces 

Health water and sanitation were also major concerns and the Red Cross was setting up mobile medical teams he said Many people rely on open wells which have been contaminated so access to clean water is a problem We are worried about communicable diseases like respiratory infections skin diseases diarrhoea he said The longer people are living in these conditions the higher their vulnerability But Mr Fuller said although the immediate emergency needs were focused on people who had had their lives swept away in seconds the Red Cross anticipated the relief effort would last six months As so often is the case the worst affected are the poorest They will have lost their homes and livelihoods Many will have worked as day labourers so they will have to start again from scratch he said It is a view shared by Sean Kenny head of communications at Action Aid who arrived in Pakistan from Britain on Thursday morning He said he was making his way straight to Kota Addu in south Punjab where there were likely to be serious effects because the area had effectively been turned into a huge lake It a very poor area in the middle of desert a bit like the Nile But it the only place where there is agriculture in the area so with all the crops damaged and hundreds of villages affected food will be a big problem He said Action Aid planned on providing food livestock fodder and mosquito nets to over a thousand households in the area The charity said medical centres were also a priority There are lots of snakes so there is a huge risk of snake bites as well as diseases such as dysentery and cholera he said The DEC an umbrella organisation of 13 UK humanitarian aid agencies said its aid had managed to reach 300,000 survivors with many UK charities distributing food water purification tablets shelter medicine and hygiene kits by raft boat and donkey But it said it urgently needed the UK public help to save more lives Chief executive Brendan Gormley said These devastating floods have left millions fighting to survive with little food clean water or shelter As monsoon rains continue unabated it is clear that the situation is deteriorating and the speed of our response is vital

Followup on Yesterday Virginia Earthquake Wednesday August 24 2011 Since I posted yesterday in the wake of the magnitude 5.8 earthquake in northern Virginia new information has come up Perhaps most obviously the magnitude has been slightly revised downward to 5.8 See current details at the US Geological Survey special page for this event Technically this may mean that yesterday event is not really the largest in Virginia history But the whole thing is hard to tell because the 5.9 event in 1897 was estimated many decades later from published reports of felt shaking and building damagethat is intensity datawhereas the 2011 quake is gauged by seismograph records for a much more accurate determination of magnitude Some damage has been documented in Washington DC most notably the fall of some decorative rockwork and buttress cracks on the National Cathedral The usual broken windows and collapsed grocery displays occurred all around the epicentral area Remember that the East Coast is all ancient brick structures Modern engineered buildings take earthquakes into account And besides older buildings very often were designed to withstand lateral loads from the occasional hurricane adding to their quake resistance The late 19th-century downtown buildings of San Francisco were designed this way and they weathered the 1906 earthquake quite well just not the fire that followed For another thing a comparable earthquake magnitude 5.3 struck southern Colorado earlier in the day the largest there in 44 years It was felt throughout Colorado and in northern New Mexico Finally at 11:37 that night a banger happened practically underneath my own housejust a reminder for West Coasters not to be complacent or condescending I guess Other Guides have been blogging about the quake Pet Supplies Guide Barbara Nefer passed along word on the behavior of the animals at the National Zoo Catholicism Guide Scott Richert urges his readers to pray for those affected by the quake I should add that Catholics may appeal to Saint Emidius who is the patron saint of earthquakes Rachel Cooper Guide to Washington DC reports on local effects and damage Financial Software Guide Shelley Elmblad takes the occasion to help us think about inventorying our possessions for insurance purposes And Nancy Parode the Senior Travel Guide points out that any of us might find ourselves in earthquake country during our travels Follow her link to travel advice too Comments Permalink

For the past two weeks Kaywall has spent 12 hours a day moving his family livestock from his inundated village to the small town of Pingrio in Sindh province in the south The goats are the only thing he has managed to save from raging waters which swept away his house and belongings Like many other flood victims he awaits help from Pakistan government My house was completely destroyed said the construction worker whose family is stranded The government has not done anything for us They are not around The scene being played out in many parts of Sindh was a troubling reminder of floods that ravaged much of Pakistan in late July and August last year Pakistan civilian leaders were slow to respond leaving the far more decisive military to take charge of rescue and relief efforts along with international aid agencies 

Some people were able to reach the one road that leads to Pingrio which is flooded in some sections and is surrounded by water on several sides Islamic charities step in Some 900 people have taken shelter there in tents run by an Islamic charity that also provided relief in last year floods Analysts say the government will lose even more credibility if charities tied to Islamist groups are seen as more helpful than the state We have enough food for people here but if more are coming in then we wo be able to feed them said Abdul Karim who runs the Islamic charity camp The 2010 floods killed about 2,000 people and made 11 million homeless in one of Pakistan worst natural disasters About 800,000 families remain without permanent shelter Victims of the new floods face uncertainty as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened The flood was over my head said Alam a 31-year-old tenant farmer with four children It came suddenly in the middle of the night while we were sleeping

Britain Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne attends a debate in central London September 2011 Photo Facundo Arrizabalaga Reuters Though you would believe it from the hacking scandal and the panoply of salacious headlines gracing Britain papers daily the actually has tougher libel laws than the There is no guaranteed freedom of speech in Britain and the truth is judged on face value with no regard to intent even if it an accidental mistake a paper is still liable And it is incumbent on the papers to prove the truth versus the public official to prove falsity You would think given such restrictions that the British media would be hyper cautious But British reporters are for the most part much more aggressive than their counterparts The hacking came about at least in part because they needed cover from the libel laws it hard to sue when the story is factual That said the stories they choose to go after are also very different from politicos Forget about uncovering the Watergate or the Pentagon Papers or perhaps a secret austerity plan to kill Britain version of Social Security When journos hack voicemails they go for the sex drugs and rock roll Take the case of George Osborne chancellor of the exchequer When he was 22 he may or may not have done cocaine and may or may not had a fling with a girl who later became a prostitute He has long denied the woman accusations which came out years ago but have been dredged up again in the hacking scandal Did the News of the World hack the woman phone to get the story as she says they did And did Andy Coulson then editor of NotW help Obsorne spin the story as the woman now alleges These are the breathless stories being served up this week by British papers Perhaps it because Barack Obama admitted up front to sampling cocaine as a college student in New York but such a story of alleged youthful indiscretion which came out in 2005 when Obsorne was Prime Minister David Cameron campaign manager seems well silly I not sure Americans would care if it emerged that Obama 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe had toked up in college and streaked naked through campus In fact such behavior might further endear Plouffe to the liberal base Britons treat such stories with amusement and mockery which tends to defang their bite The has a rich history of sex and humor the carry on movies the saucy postcards And while the scandals have certainly brought down careers there are also survivors London Mayor Boris Johnson comes to mind There is a certain orgiastic glee with which the British papers approach such stories as if embarrassment is a dish to be feasted upon Yet despite approaching it with the mentality of a teenage boy the British are much more upfront and unblinking about these peccadilloes More than 15 years later the political press corps is still suffering from a Monica Lewinsky hangover Former Florida Mark Foley instant messages with congressional pages were shopped to media outlets for months before ABC finally bit Rumors have circulated for years about Bill Clinton extracurricular activities but the only place I seen them in print was in the book Game Change And if it had been for the National Enquirer John Edwards might have gotten away with a pretty unbelievable affair such was the distaste for that story amongst the twitterati In fact the American press is perhaps dangerously prudish in its refusal to look at sex which leaves a gaping hole if some potentially serious transgression occurs What if a President or Speaker was having an affair with a lobbyist What if they were being blackmailed to keep the affair secret That not to say that publications do cover sex scandals Recent ones have included David Vitter alleged penchant for diapers Larry wide stance Craig John Ensign gross abuse of his staff Eric tickle me Massa and Chris Lee of Craig List fame In the the smallest hint of impropriety can bring down a career even if the only transgressions were in the eyes of God not the law as with Anthony Weiner The Weiner sent suggestive photos of himself to women he met on Facebook but maintained he never physically engaged with them Democrats who demanded at the time that Weiner resign when no laws had been broken are probably now regretting their words given they just lost his seat in a special election on Tuesday If the British press is akin to a pubescent boy than their American counterparts are puritanical old ladies Perhaps one day both might find a more liberated approach to covering sex 

Unpacking the water storage question Posted on September 14 2011 Comment Great job by Jay Lund in unpacking the issue of California water storage how much it has how its used and what role it might play going forward Climate warming is reducing the ability of Californias snowpack to store water seasonally Fortunately downstream reservoirs on many streams are already large compared to seasonal changes in streamflows and flood peaks Model results show that with the right management climate warming might be inconvenient not catastrophic for most water uses Its not all about climate change its really about how the system fits together I recommend the whole thing 

Desal is apparently now a jobs program Posted on September 12 2011 Comment Im all for a serious discussion about the costs and benefits of desalination as a source of water supply in the arid southwestern United States But I find this argument from Ted Owen of the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce less than helpful Jobs Everyone in business and government is talking about the need to create jobs but so few seem to have any real jobs to offer On Tuesday the Carlsbad City Council will be put to the test and we will witness a display of leadership that will help reaffirm our faith that local government can be part of the jobs solution On the City Councils agenda is an agreement between the city and the San Diego County Water Authority that will advance the Carlsbad Desalination Project The agreement probably doesnt give the city everything it originally wanted and the same is likely true for the County Water Authority And it is this compromise that exemplifies what leadership is all about having the foresight to put the greater good of the region above parochial interests The desalination project is one of the largest water infrastructure projects in the state of California It will support 2,000 skilled jobs and generate more than 350 million in economic stimulus during construction and contribute more than 50 million per year to the regional economy once operations begin in 2014 It is also the case that having Carlsbad City Council hire hooligans to go around breaking windows downtown would create jobs for people who fix windows But that is not sufficient motivation for hiring the hooligans Now to be fair Owen does mention in passing the argument that the desal project offers some water policy benefits as well But desal only works if its affordable which has been one of the rips against the Carlsbad project And the notion of the desal plant as a jobs program works best if its extravagantly expensive It seems the two lines of arguments are at cross purposes here 

Stuff I wrote elsewhere It didnt all burn like that Posted on September 2011 Comment From yesterdays newspaper a reminder that not all the area within the boundaries of this years big New Mexico forest fires is burned to an ugly indecipherable ecological cinder req There is good reason to visit the moonscape and to talk about what happens next to the ecosystem there the subject of a future story and the main reason Adolphe and I asked Allen to show us around But there is something misleading about the way journalists cover disasters We are drawn to the worst of the worst the most devastating flooding the epicenter of the earthquake damage zone the moonscape around Peters Dome Remember this as you watch us going into disaster mode The situation is likely not as severe as the parts were showing you 

For the past two weeks Kaywall has spent 12 hours a day moving his family livestock from his inundated village to the small town of Pingrio in Sindh province in the south The goats are the only thing he has managed to save from raging waters which swept away his house and belongings Like many other flood victims he awaits help from Pakistan government My house was completely destroyed said the construction worker whose family is stranded The government has not done anything for us They are not around The scene being played out in many parts of Sindh was a troubling reminder of floods that ravaged much of Pakistan in late July and August last year Pakistan civilian leaders were slow to respond leaving the far more decisive military to take charge of rescue and relief efforts along with international aid agencies 

Some people were able to reach the one road that leads to Pingrio which is flooded in some sections and is surrounded by water on several sides Islamic charities step in Some 900 people have taken shelter there in tents run by an Islamic charity that also provided relief in last year floods Analysts say the government will lose even more credibility if charities tied to Islamist groups are seen as more helpful than the state We have enough food for people here but if more are coming in then we wo be able to feed them said Abdul Karim who runs the Islamic charity camp The 2010 floods killed about 2,000 people and made 11 million homeless in one of Pakistan worst natural disasters About 800,000 families remain without permanent shelter Victims of the new floods face uncertainty as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened The flood was over my head said Alam a 31-year-old tenant farmer with four children It came suddenly in the middle of the night while we were sleeping

Have you tried Earth Learning Ideas river in a small gutter which investigates how flowing water erodes soft sediment or rattle and roll which demonstrates that some rocks are more resistant to erosion than others Pupils at St Paul Junior School Luyanzi Uganda were lucky enough to study river erosion closely by visiting the Kalagala Falls on the River Nile Here there are spectacular waterfalls and rapids in the river The following photo shows the river being constrained by resistant rocks on either you can see the start of the waterfalls you want to run some fieldwork outside do try science out of you have some photos of pupils doing fieldwork we shall be pleased to display them 

The Colorado River andits tributariesare life to the Southwest It is the only major water source for Arizona and Nevada and is a critical component of the water used by California Colorado Utah Wyoming and Northern Mexico Any discussions of water allocation and the effects of ongoing climate change on the riverare political minefields To many people though the Colorado Rivermeans the Grand Canyon in Arizona Those whoare more familiar withthe area realize the Colorado represents many canyons The river drainage crosses so many unique landscapes that no single description can characterize the river Cataract Canyon Black Canyon two of those one in Colorado on the Gunnison tributary and the other downstream of Lake Mead Flaming Gorge and Lodore on the Green River tributary and many others 

Despite the late August visit there was alot of water for a central California River A lot of them are dry by now The mountains upstream reach a mile above sea level and they catch a lot of rainfall Enough sinks into the ground that springs keep the river flowing The babbling brook contrasts nicely with the crashing had a delightful time looking at chunks of gneiss schist marble and granitic rock 

Ravenswood Generating Station in Long Island City akaBig Allis after the generator inside When it opened in 1963 it was the largest electrical generating unit in the world It produces 20 of New York Citys energy needs FOP 2011 Its not news to repeat readers of this blog that humans are both intimately living with and rapidly using up materials that took scores of millions of years to form Or that humans enculturate geologic materials transforming them into products affordances architectures and most of us dont immediately think of geologic things when we pay our electricity bills or surf the internet Humans rarely connect seemingly immaterial things such as energy and electricity with the interminably slow processes monumental temperatures and pressures and sheer mass of matter that it takes to compose many of the substances that power our lights and computers Yet when we acknowledge the reality of ever increasing energy demand dwindling reserves and the precarious nature of many of our electricity generating and delivery infrastructures it is clear why energy has become one of the most pressing issues humans face In an effort to create new contexts for energy to be sensed as a tangible materialand perhaps even living force in our livesFOP is launching a artist project in collaboration with The New Schools Vera List Center and the Office for Sustainability Facilities Management In response to the Centers 2011-13 theme of thingness FOPs project is entitled The Thingness of Energy We will explore literally the things that fuel The New School by creating artworks that invite audiences students faculty staff and the public to newly sense energy as being composed of materials that result from and contribute to geologic forces and flows from The New Schools 2011Climate Action Plan The Thingness of Energy will take up a of energy related topics including some related to the current draft of The New SchoolsClimate Action Plan with its ambitious goal of becoming a carbon neutral institution by 2040 With the support of Security Systems and Facilities staff we will use The New School as a for documentingwhere and how energy flows into and through an urban campus along entry and exit points for wires and cables electrical outlets and breaker boxes ventilation ductsand the carbon intensive spots such as server rooms Well attempt to untangle and trace local manifestations of the seemingly indecipherable grid that supplies electricity to New York City and in turn The New School including theEastern Interconnectionand theNortheast Power Coordinating Council NPCC distribution board via wikicommons As author Jane Bennett has said the electrical grid is a better understood as a volatile mix of coal sweat electromagnetic fields computer programs electron streams profit motives heat lifestyles nuclear fuel plastic fantasies of mastery static legislation water economic theory wire and wood to name just some of the actants Vibrant Matter 25 from Bennetts insights FOP will also follow the flows and effects of and heating oils naturalgas nuclear power coal hydro power and steam not only through the walls of The New School and around the City but upriver upstateand beyond considering how these energy things are forms of vibrant matter substances in motion thatact both with and independently of human actions and desires transmission substationvia wikicommons Our approach will be but the outcomes will be aesthetic We will creatively respond to equivalents such as the hertz lumen and kelvin invented by humans in attempts to grasp and quantify the scales and speeds of the raw heat and light We look forward to finding ways to make palpable the monumental scale of difference between a watt and a gigawatt and to designing ways to actually sense the thingness of the British Thermal Unit one BTU is equivalent to a single burning match We plan to construct five interactive boxes tag them with GPS coordinates and install them throughout The New School during the spring of 2012 These boxes will function both as art installations and as pedagogical provocations for students faculty and the public to engage Updates and related to the project will be posted throughout the next year A primary goal for The Thingness of Energy is to render and palpable the complex monumental histories of the earth materials that are converted into energy and then transported along remote and local grids to power the production of knowledge at urban universities such as The New School The Vera List Center for Art and Politics has begun to announce its programming for Fall 2011 Theinaugural lecture for the 2011-13 theme of thingness will take place on September 13th at 6:30 pmand be presented by Janet Bennett author of theVibrant Matter Share this ShareTwitterStumbleUponEmailFacebook Comments 

For example NHK recently reported Japans land ministry will change its policy on tsunami preparedness in the wake of the March 11th ministry now prioritizes hardware such as embankments but will shift to an approach that combines physical measures with software such as setting up more secure escape decision comes after the March 11th tsunami overwhelmed coastal embankments Experts say the national policy of prioritizing embankments was insufficient and that better evacuation routes should be the heart of the new policy is the land ministrys goal of developing cities on the premise thathardware alone can not stop a tsunami emphasis added In the past governments corporations and institutions have looked to companies such as Weidlinger Associatesto better their chances of incurring less damage when the unimaginable occurs Weidlinger is renowned forbuilding structures hardware that attempt to deflect and withstand incredible amounts of energy and offer ing special services in vulnerability assessment risk analysis forensic earthquake wind and blast engineering interaction and sustainability Yet even before last March there was growing interest in what software or soft systems might contribute to infrastructural preparation Last September for example a publication platform entitled bracket announced a call for submissions for a special issue entitledbracket goes soft bracket claimed that the notion of soft systems has gained increasing traction as a counterpoint to permanent static and hard systems The special issue aimed to investigate physical and virtual soft systems as they pertain to infrastructure ecologies landscapes environments and networks and question the use and role of responsive indeterminate flexible and immaterial systems in design Seeaccepted selectionsto the call After the events in Japan the sense that hardware alone isnt and never has been enough has only deepened The idea that soft systems might as bracket put it have the ability to deal with imprecision and uncertainty with the aim of achieving more malleable robust solutions seems like a hunch worthy of testing out In response to the recent 82 acre landslide triggered by the soil left behind byLake Champlains Pleistocene precursor Geoff Manaughasked what happens to architecture when solid earth becomes more like the ocean A followup question might be if we cant build ourselves into safety through architecture and infrastructure might we design soft systems that enable humans toassemble with rather than resist geologic forces even as theearth moves In contexts of earthquakes tsunamis and massive landslides hard systems cant function as sole solutions FOP cant help but think that something essential is missing in any approach that relies on infrastructure alone to meet dynamic earth forces All infrastructures no matter how mightily built have limits that earth forces canand will eventuallysupersede A more nimble approach would be to design built systems to function in concert with human systems that are ready to move quickly and responsively in relation to monumental forces when they arrive Engineers architects and designers would then assume the task of configuring the structures they build in relation to human systems For example the tsunami wall as rigid structuredoes not provide more safety than a soft system such as one in which humans who live nearby know the limits of the wall as well asthe quickest tsunamis evacuation route Humans who act swiftly and knowledgeably in the face of geologic events rather than relying on infrastructure alone to protect them or deflect forces create a new kind of vitally responsive soft system that includes but does not rely solely on hard systems The Japanese land ministry said it has learned that hardware alone can not stop a tsunami Might the next realizations be thatnothing can actually stop a tsunami And humans must invent multiple systems including the dispersion of knowledge that recognize the magnitude of tsunamis and attempt to move in relation to their force human assemblages in Shibuya FOP 2008 The present moment is filled with unanswerable questions and incredibly high risks the likelihood that a major quake will occur in the next decade beneath greater Tokyo home to 13.1 million people has doubled since the March Nevertheless this momentstands charged with the potential to manifest new responsive human systems Japan a culture known for its conformist tendencies is also known for its innovation powerful use of media and resilience in the face of disaster Despite irrevocable failures of preparation communication and handling of events related to the triple disaster major cultural shifts are reshaping what it means to be Japanese and what it will mean to live in Japan from here forward geologic map of Japan Refusing to deny the reality that another earthquake or tsunami is possible and breaking silences enforced by cultural pressure many Japanese now admit that existing infrastructures especially nuclear are perilously unprepared for the next geologic event We sense these shifts are evidence that Japanese people have gained crucial insights by simply taking the time to pause and consider what the past three months have been like for those most directly affected The desire for change in Japan likely stems at least in part from taking to heart such painfully honest comments as those of the 39-year-old man who said hefears radiation because it can not be seen or the farmer near Fukushima who said he is relieved that his cows can survive in a different place but he is angry that hecould have continued dairy farmingif it had not been for the nuclear accident Despite the fact that infrastructural change cant be implemented as quickly as everyone wants change has begun And it seems to have been ushered in by Japanese people demanding they be given more agency as an informed population andimagining or offering themselves as actants in new soft systems During the recovery process FOP will be paying close attention to emergent human systems in Japan and how they assemble with hard systems that are both necessary and in need of rethinking Perhaps Japans emergent human systems are the beginning of a much larger global shift Perhaps they signal the potential forif not the actual arrival ofa next chapter of human evolution If the worlds third largest economy actually manages to adapt to the reality of having 25 less energy this summer might it be a signal that humans are now capable of scaling themselves and their lifestyles in relation to the limits of geologic material and force 

wicked reality in Los Alamos and the realms of dreams andinstincts 06.29.2011 4:30 pm Filed under Uncategorized FOP just returned from New Mexico On Sunday June 26th the Las Conchas fire ignited in the Jemez Mountains near Los Alamos By the time we were heading to the airport in Albuquerque to return to New York on Monday the fire had swelled to more than 40 square miles Today at the time of this writing the fire nearly exceeds 100 square miles of unpredictable blaze and is only contained The state of New Mexico has already experienced hundreds of fires this season likely facilitated by this years second driest start to a new year in recorded history This parched foundation has set the stage for extreme fire hazard illustrated by the fact that the Cerro Grande a large and devastating fire that developed outside Los Alamos in 2000 took two weeks to grow to the size the Las Conchas fire achieved in its first 24 hours FOP was in Santa fe last week for FOP Elizabeth Ellsworthspresentation at the Santa Fe Instituteentitled Wicked Problems Novel Modes of Behavior and the Power of Pedagogical did we know a wicked problem was only hours from developing in the immediate vicinity the Las Conchas fire as seen from Santa Fe the evening of June 26th FOP 2011 Wicked problems asweve written about before are problems for which each attempt to create a solution changes the understanding of the problem Wicked problems can not be solved in a traditional linear fashion because the problem definition evolves as new possible solutions are considered implemented CogNexus Institute The term was originally coined byHorst Rittel We think the notion of wicked problems can be helpful when considering ways to respond and design in relation to contexts where human designed nuclear infrastructures be confronted by unpredictable geologic forces such as floods earthquakes and forest fires What if thedesign specification for all nuclear infrastructures power plants long and waste storage nuclear weapons testing facilities etc started with the assumption that the nuclear is a wicked problem This would mean that scenarios that combined the risk of tsunami earthquake and power failure happeningtogether would be considered as possible Are inflated bermsabest attempt for handling the wicked problems currently being generated by river flooding near nuclear power plants in Nebraska Is a plan that places safetys threshold feet of water when this years flood waters have risen to 1006 feet a best attempt Might we want to have more than eight dry feet between us and vast amounts of spent nuclear fuel Are the designers and engineers of a new plutonium production facility ready to meet the wicked problems of aseismically active fire prone mesa In the context of wicked problems its worth acknowledging that there is a lot of fear circulating in discourses about the Los Alamos fire Given the reality that the lab contains handles and stores radioactive materials these fears arent completely unfounded How might public concern questions and instinctual responses feed into the consideration of the wicked problems we face Might public opinionbe a major factor to be designed in relation to Today we found it interesting to witness how major news sources appear to be conflicted about how to detail fears expressed by local citizens near the Los Alamos fire We found similar conflicts hinted at in the days following the Fukushima Daiichi plant meltdowns There seems to be a struggle to find a balance between acknowledgingwhat the public is sensing to be a real threat and reporting what official statements disclose Both seem necessary to gaining a full sense of what is the real situation in New Mexico right now This morning at 7:38 the New York Times released a story by the AP that included provocative comments by nearby residents of Los Alamos highlighted below By 11:30 the story under the same title and link had been edited and all personal commentary had been removed Its hard to imagine that the personal feelings of this resident have dissipated as quickly as they disappeared in this story

New York has elaborate systems in place to protect humans from the dangerous geologic and biological agents that water can so easily deliver How well they all work is a subject of growing debate In 2010 The New York Times published an extended series called Toxic Waters It includes state by state information about how water pollution affects local drinking water For New York state the Whats in your Water piece facilities that have permits to release pollutants The online version of the article invites readers to enter a zip code and view information on companies that actively discharge pollutants in their local area Human dependence on water to survive means that any attempt to harness and safely deliver water throughout a place as large as New York City becomes big business requiring enormous infrastructure Its a highly impressive feat to deliver 8+ million residents plus visitors and residents of Westchester Putnam Ulster and Orange counties more than one billion gallons of potable drinking waterevery day Flows that arrive from beyond the Citys edges are often propelled bymonumental forms of these flows are assisted by ancient geomorphologies such as the now highly eroded slopes of prehistoric mountains north and west of the city The remarkable reality of NYC drinking waterreaches homes and businesses today through gravity alone is an incredible gift from the geologic past that preceded New Yorks existence as city 

from the Impact Assessment of Natural Gas Production in the New York City Water Supply Watershed report 2009 Still humans have a huge active hand in channeling water from Upstate into the homes of millions of New Yorkers Tunnels pipes aqueducts and channels pass under the streets through our walls and in places beyond our wildest imaginations to usher the regions water into our daily lives The City actually divers to live for more than a monthat a time in a sealed 24-foot tubular pressurized tank complete with showers a television and a Nerf basketball hoop breathing air that is 97.5 percent helium and 2.5 percent oxygen The divers assess and repair aging and cracked tunnel infrastructure which has been known to leak upwards of 35 million gallons a day City Water Tunnel No a 60 mile longtunnel which has been under construction since 1970 is a noteworthy piece of the ever growing NYC water delivery puzzle Tunnel No is slated to be completed in 2020 at a cost of billion dollars It involves drilling through bedrock at depths over 800 feet This hulking passageway will help alleviate the reliance placed on Water Tunnel No dating to 1917 and Water Tunnel No dating to 1936 Tunnel No will allow these older tunnels to be shut down inspected and repaired for the first time since they came online nearly a century ago In an attempt to physically trace some of the geologic and infrastructural flows of New York Citys water system for Geologic City FOP decided to visit the one reservoir that exists within the five boroughs Jerome Park Reservoir in the Bronx The better knownCentral Park reservoir was decommissioned in 1993 due to the construction of City Water Tunnel No Apparently should it ever be tapped thirsty New Yorkers could drain the entire picturesqueCentral Park Reservoir within just four hours The Jerome Park Reservoir was built to hold water conducted to the city by the New Croton Aqueduct which replaced the Old Croton Aqueduct built in the 1830s and 1840s to supply New York City with fresh water from the newly constructed Croton Reservoir in Westchester At first the old aqueduct provided the city with enough clean water to allow it to combat the fires and epidemics that had plagued the city However the demand created by a growing population outstripped the supply of clean water and in the 1880s plans were laid for the New Croton Aqueduct The new aqueduct tunneled through rock terminating at the Jerome Park Reservoir Later the city built aqueducts to obtain water from the Catskill Mountains and the Delaware River Today the city receives about 10 percent of its water from the Croton system and 90 percent from the Delaware and Catskill systems NYC parks Jerome Park Reservoir When we arrived at the Jerome Park Reservoir we found it completely drained inaccessible and looking more like an abandoned shallow quarry than a vital part of metropolitan infrastructure The Jerome Reservoir has been offline since 2008 because of the construction of the nearby Croton Filtration Plant expected to be completed in 2012-13 The site includes a plant being built entirely underground that will treat 1.2 million cubic meters of water per day Once the Plant is completed about 30 percent of the Citys water supply will pass though Jerome Park Our visit gave us a palpable sense of the role that Jerome Park is designed have as a holding zone for the Citys water supply As tends to be the case in New York we left this site knowing that what we saw from street level was just a small piece of a more extensive network of infrastructure geology that extended below our feet into the depths of the bedrock and to locations far beyond the Citys edges the empty Jerome Park Reservoir May 2011 current water levels for all reservoir levels can be seen on the DEP site Downstream from Jerome Park back in Brooklyn along the East River it was easier to observe the Citys water flows in action From the heights of the Brooklyn Manhattan Williamsburg or Queensboro Bridge the force of water on the move is highly visible Still its likely that thousands of people who pass over these bridges each day or stroll along the Rivers edges have not noticed that the Rivers current changes directions twice each day East River from the Manhattan Bridge in 2006 Five years ago staged a project that attempted to signal the reversal of the Rivers flow East River Reverses anchored two volunteer kayakers in the East River for hours Over that time their kayaks changed direction from pointing north to pointing south We documented the phenomenon from above and along the waters edge addressed questions from passersby and handed out informationhighlighting the fact that the East River isnt actually a river but a tidal estuary that reverses with the tug of the ocean tides signaling the reversal the Rivers reversal in 2006 Similar to the fortuitous geomorphologies that assist the flow of drinking into New York the East Rivers tidal force is aiding an innovative energy project nearing Federal approval Along the East Channel of the East River Verdant Power plans to install 30 hydro turbines in 2012 for Phase of theRITE project The completed project will be thefirst tidal power plant in the world licensed to transmit energy onto a national grid We find it inspiring that these turbines could generate power for more than three million homesby simply tapping into the geologic forces that have been at play in the region for the past several thousand years view of the East Rivers East Channel looking south from Roosevelt Island In late May we rodethe tram from Manhattan to Roosevelt Island and took a look at the potential site The tidal power plant project has had multiple initial attempts The tides proved so strong they literally destroyed the blades of the prototypes The initial turbine blades were made of fiberglass stretched over a steel skeleton The next iteration used aluminum magnesium alloy blades In the next attempt the blades will be composed of plastic and iron Perhaps this fusion composed of both Precambrian and Anthropocene materiality will be up for the challenge of meeting the Rivers massive tidal forces For FOP the RITE project dramatically highlights the often overlooked geologic forces that course right through in the City Designers and engineers of this project have chosen to tap one of the Citys dynamic geologic flows in a way that brings something unprecedented into reality With the tidal power plant humans assemble with the geologic force of the East River to remix water as a geologic agent with other earth materials and forces in ways that create not only energy but also a more elaborated version of New York as geologic city view from the Roosevelt Island Tram of the West and East Channel of the East River With these last site visits complete we now step back from our field reports to design and produce the print version of theGeologic City field guide Well have updates later this summer and information about the pieces availability in early fall Stay tuned all Geologic City related posts can be found here 10 11 12| 

In recent FOP posts we wrote about designs that we deem to illustrate best attempts by humans to create materials practices and infrastructures capable of meetingmonumental forces of geologic time and materiality some for time spans of 1,000 to 1,000,000 years We continue to be interested in designs and aesthetic responses that are created in the face of such uncertainty Our list of such projectsis growing as we watch highly designed materials such as DeconGel literally pull off or stick to the radioactive materials contaminating the earth around the Fukushima plants Where the contaminated gel will go once its been used no one knows But at the moment it appears to be one of the worlds best attempts for consolidating the spread of airborne nuclear materiality The lastest news is that there were actually three meltdowns in the first 18 hours after the March 11th earthquake and tsunami in Japan Obviously TEPCO workers and contractors face a task worthy of Sisyphus They must attempt to manage as in contain this extremely dangerous site full of invisible moving volatile materiality while simultaneously attempting to shield themselves the ocean land and surrounding population from its spreading contamination And they must do this apparently into eternity The materials engineering and design skills available to their work will be major actants in this continuing struggle A recent press releasefrom TEPCO suggests that a cover or containment structure would be an extremely useful next step The press release entitled Commencement of a preparation work for the installation of a cover for the reactor building of Unit Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station briefly explains that a containment cover will be built around Reactor in early June 2011.The cover will be a best attempt to reduce the consequences of the ongoing disaster a schemata of the structure designed to help contain Reactor at the Fukushima plant in June 2011 While none exist at the present moment the preferred environment for containing nuclear materials is a deepgeologic repository far from people animals and the instabilities of the surface of the earth Situated in the open air at the edge of the Pacific Ocean and exposed to active meteorological forcessuch as the typhoon that is approaching at the time of this writing theFukushima sitecouldnt occupy a more opposite environmental scenario As Fukushima continues to test if not defy the best knowledge of the experts especially those who insisted in the days after the quakethat the situation inJapan would never reach the severity of Chernobyl wecant help but think in terms of best attempts Just how long is this new containment cover designed to last Back in 1986 an Object Shelter more colloquially known as the sarcophagus was desperately and hurriedly erected over the Chernobyl site In place ever since it has proven wholly insufficient Is the cover at Unit intended to be a temporary fix If so will it like Chernobyls Shelter mark only the beginning of what will become discussions repeated desperate rallies for economic support and incredible acts of human risk In other words how much human labor and life force will need to be redirected to meet situations such as Fukushima situations that never reach their end Tellingly Chernobyls Object Shelter is now cracked and crumbling Twenty five years after the accident there the area still poses an imminent risk of the release of massive amounts of building of a replacement container called the New Safe Confinement finally began in September 2010 It is expected to take five years to complete You canwatch a fascinating nine minute video on the installation process also appears that the events in Fukushima have become a motivating catalyst for securing the stalled funding to complete the New Safe Confinement project by 2015 Radiation around the Chernobyl site isstill too highfor workers to be present for long periods of time So the new structure will be constructed in two pieces some distance from the site and then slid into place on rails For its scale alone the Confinement sets new precedents for best attempts in design It will be visible from space tall enough to contain the Statue of Liberty and weighing in around 32,000 tons it will be one of the heaviest objects to ever be moved Yet as Steve Rose has written Chernobyls New Safe Confinements purpose is not to shield radioactive emissions but to prevent the release of radioactive dustand other materials and to keep out rainwater which could carry contaminants into the water table This means that the best attempt of today remains merely the first step of many yet to be determined Only in 100 years will authorities finally be able to start dismantling the reactor inside There is no certainty of where contaminated parts will go at that time including 200 tons of uranium and ton of plutonium For this design challenge another best attempt will have to be invented schemata of the New Safe Confinement for Chernobyl The New Safe Confinement will likely do the job it is intended to do which is confine nuclear material within a nuclear for the next 100 years When we came across the wordsof Iain Macdonald an architect with YRM commenting on the Confinements design we agreed that something is lacking from the entire public discourse surrounding these monumentally important projects Macdonald was quoted as saying 

Highway Lofoten Norway and Olstinden peak inHamny harbor in the early morning hours of May 2011 We had been traveling since and it was now 9:30 The light was surprisingly even as we disembarked from the boat in Svolvr We were now at 68 N above the arctic circle on the archipelago of Lofoten Norway Here a grade of light that usually passes in 10-15 minutes at sunrise or sunset will hang on for hours transitioning into darker hues at a rate barely perceptible to the human eye When we told the Avis rental car employee that we thought we had a two hour drive ahead of us he simply answered back well its 122 km We thought yes just less than two hours then and it will still be light out when we arrive We were heading for the last town at the end of the road on this remote island chain off of northern Norway What we experienced along our drive can be explained at least partially by the mix of bodily sensations and mental states that we arrived with jet lag general disorientation travelers glee and the still vivid reality that just days before we had actuallywalked inside the eruptive crack between two continental tectonic plates But what we can not account for is the mounting tension and sense of foreboding that overtook us during this drive During the three and a half hours it took to cover 122 km something portentous engulfed us We seemed to be traveling in something other than space and time Even as we grew more exhausted we felt ourselves becoming ever more implicated inmore drawn out into and acrossour surroundings The outside and inside of the car blurred as rain began to fall Rock faces darkened and moved closer to the roads edge The sea beside the road grew more immediately present The only two photos we took were afterthoughts anomalous moments when we felt capable of actually reaching for the camera During most of the drive we had lost ability to act or understand our feelings or our situation with any distance or perspective The road narrowed fromtwo lanes to scarcely one Our driving surface became a thin and fragile ribbon that curved with the contours of the fjords and lifted us towards the low when we crossed the multitude of bridges At each bridge only one car was allowed to cross at a time We sat anxiously at our end unable to see who or what might be cresting the arch of the bridge until aglowing traffic light signaled apparently safe passage by silently changing from red to yellow to green Despite the light of the near midnight sun it was late and getting later We passed only a handful of cars and many road signs whose Norwegian we couldnt decipher The longer we drove the more it seemed that our small car was being pressed against impenetrable vertical walls of black wet stone On the of the road the formations rose immediately from the pavement to their 3000 heights where instead of sloping away from us to form a peak they actually curved forward to loom over the road and our heads On the of the road an twilight descended into and became the lapping sea water After two hours guard rails and reflectors disappeared Agility driving became the primary task as the wet road could be distinguished from the foggy dusk by a few shades of gray We passed through tunnel after tunnellong channels blasted through mountains and the raw rock left exposed Descent into these tunnels conjured visions of entering Onkalo When some plunged downwardwe realized we were driving under fjords of the arctic Norwegian Sea 

Twilight developed into outside the window but somehow we were able to sense color in the water on the fjord side of the car Along our peripheral vision our retinas managed to pick up a faint glowing turquoise color from inside the waves By now we could have been easily convinced that something unknown to us had happenedand that the drive had become literally endless Fishing village after fishing village continued to appear around each turneven after we were certain that next one would be our destination We were heading directly into the area Edgar Allen Poe dramatized inA Descent into the Maelstrom 1841 Thefurther we drove the more impossible a return seemed Later in the full light of the day we disclosed thoughts to each other about the drive and the process of arrival to We realized that something profound had happened to each of us and that we had been unable to speak about it while it was happening We used words like menacing beauty and sense of peril to describe feelings that had sent us into a deep silence as separately we lived out the situation One of us had been reminded of our first trip toWalter DeMarias Lightning Field in New Mexico There the work of art had spontaneously transformed into a malevolent array of organized confinement The piece appeared as a closed loop of piercing steel referring only to itselfa tight grid of calculated inward turnings Yet after several hours of walking around and through the site the work opened and became an experience of the process of arrival and place In the mornings light DeMarias piece seemed to vanish into the magnificent air light soil and solitude of the remote high desert That was the moment we realized we had truly arrived thereand that the piece had actually afforded this process The next morning at even when inside our cabin we could feel the mountains outside Wehad the sense that we were in the presence of something very very old Something that had spanned time vaster than we had ever come in direct contact with How else could these mountains which were much smaller than peaks we had traveled through in the United States such as the Sierra Nevadas exude the commanding force that had seeped into our car What monumental events and spans of time had they endured After several days we found language for these sensations We invented terms such as latitude sickness We also found ourselves googling Stendhal Syndrome the disease that plagues art lovers causing them to sweat faint weep vomit experience vertigo heart palpitationsor even collapse in front of paintings most commonly in front of Italian works of art Stendhal syndrome was coined in the early 1800s by Graziella Magherini the head of a department of psychiatry She proposed that the syndrome be considered a medical affliction As visual studies scholar James Elkins details in his book Pictures and Tears A history of people who have cried in front of Paintings Stendhal himself described his dizzying experience in Italy in the following words I was in a sort of ecstasy I had arrived at that emotional point where one meets the celestial sensations given by the fine arts and by passionate sentiments I had heart palpitations leaving Santa Crocewhat they call nerves in Berlinand the life was nearly drained out of me Another of Magherinis patients Kamil a young man from Czechoslovakia explained his experience this way I couldnt move I was stretched out on the ground and I felt as if I were leaving my body as if I were leaking out of myself like a liquid 

For the first time since Pakistan worst floods on record wreaked havoc across the country IOM staff have met people living in Punjab villages they had previously trained in disaster preparedness According to villagers in Jhang district in the heart of Punjab 122 local volunteers were able to rescue approximately 1,000 flood victims during the disaster thanks to the IOM training We were a group of seven volunteers and three members of the government rescue force and managed to rescue 155 people stuck in their flooded village in just one day said Shahid 

A river represents the perfect fusion between geology and culture Rivers are characterizesd generally speaking both by erosion and deposition this is where the geology aspect comes from Think of the Grand Canyonand you can visualize the results of river erosion through time Take a canoe down or up a river stop on the river bank for lunch and look around the canoe trip and the lunch break will help you witness river processes deposition and their resulting features Rivers are also amazing cultural centers in the sense that human settlements usually started along a river Any major city in Europe for example is associated with a river and the list could go on This is where the cultural aspect comes from With this post I am starting a trip along a river the Arges River in Romania to be more precise I imagine I am a rock particle or a water molecule originating from the Southern Carpathians and traveling along the Arges River all the way to the Danube The trip will witness some amazing history geological and human culture and landscapes The Arges River headwaters are located in the Southern Carpathians between the two highest mountain peaks in Romania Moldoveanu and Negoiu 

Glaciers can influence societies in their catchment area in different ways they act as a water storage for dry summers but glaciers can also trigger geological catastrophes and endanger outburst floods GOF refer to the rapid and sudden discharge of water from within a glacier or from an lake within minutes to hours a flood wave occurs possibly damaging infrastructures and killing people kilometres away from the glacier which initiated the disaster In the Alps and North America most outburst floods occur in summertime when during large quantities of water can accumulate inside the glacier or as the Andes and the Himalaya also a second type of floods is common outbursts from lakes referred as glacial lake outburst flood GLOF area between the moraine and the retreating glacier can be filled with the and as the glacier continues to shrink the lake continues to grow Various processes can lead to the failure of a moraine dam waves and currents of the lake can erode the dam ice contained in the dam can melt the detritus forming the dam can settle with time and so lowering the effective height of the Laguna Paron 4.140m Cordillera Blanca Peru foto from Wikipedia in 2009 a lake dammed by the glacier Hatunraju with a capacity of 75 million cubic metres before the lake level was lowered by 20 meters artificially by tunnelling through bedrock on the left of the moraine dam The lake is surrounded by moraines 250m high It is unknown how stable the moraine of Hatunraju is if this dam fails a flood of around 50 million cubic metres could sweep downstream and severely damage the town of Caraz 16 kilometres away The worst glacial lake outburst in historic time was caused by the failure of such a in Peru December 1941 the town of Huaraz was partially destroyed by a flood that killed 60.000 resulting from failure have been increasing in frequency in the Himalaya over the past 70 years or so although in terms of loss of life they have been by accident much less disastrous then in the Andes One of the outburst floods in Nepal took place on August 1985 when the terminus of the Langmoche Glacier in the Khumbu Himal collapsed into Dig Tsho glacial lake Video creating a displacement wave hat overtopped the moraine dam and triggered its collapse Estimated 10 million cubic metres of water were released the wave destroyed a power plant and five people were killed and eroded and destabilized the valley floor for 90 kilometres downstream This case triggered major research projects of potential dangerous glaciers and glacial lakes until 2004 more then 20 potentially dangerous lakes in Nepal and 24 in Bhutan were identified one of the most impressive and dangerous case was lake Tsho Rolpa 4.450m fed by the Trakarding Glacier By 2002 the lake was 3,5 kilometres long 0,5 kilometres width and 135m deep with an estimated volume of 110 million cubic metres The moraine damming the lake up was 150m high with a core of decaying ice Emergency measures were initiated with the installation of an system to detect downstream travelling a and later by the construction of an artificial spillway lowering the lake by metres However these are considered only temporary solutions as a lowering of the lake level by at lest 15 to 20 metres is necessary to prevent spillover or failure of the dam crest a costly procedure in this region This last case shows also the financial problems facing poor countries often disaster prevention or mitigation are limited by the available resources and considering the continuing glacier retreat expected in the next decades the increase of problematic lakes both in number and volume will by of major concern in the future The glacierized Himalayan border region of Bhutan bottom and Tibet top seen in a satellite image From the crest of the mountain range clean glaciers flow northwards onto the Tibetan Plateau while glaciers flow south into densely forested bottom right are a series of lakes and incipient lakes formed by the rapid coalescence of supraglacial ponds The large lake at the very right is lake Luggye Tsho A breach of the dam in 1994 led to severe flooding and loss of life up to 200 kilometres downstream by NASA 08 June 2006 Bibliography HAMBREY ALEAN J 2004 Glaciers 2nd ed Cambridge University Press 377HORSTMANN B 2004 Glacial Lake Outburst Floods in Nepal and Switzerland New Threats Due to Climatic Change Germanwatch Bundesministerium fr wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung KALTENBORN NELLEMANN VISTNESS I Eds 2010 High mountain glaciers and climate change Challenges to human livelihoods and adaptation United Nations Environment Programme 

It has already been said that no small part of the present work refers to the nature and phenomena of glaciers It may be well therefore before proceeding to details to explain a little the state of our present knowledge respecting these great which are objects of a kind to interest even those who know them only from description whilst those who have actually witnessed their wonderfully striking and grand characteristics can hardly need an inducement to enter into some inquiry respecting their nature and origin James Forbes 1900 Travels Trough the Alps page 17 Wolf and Descourtis La Grosse Pierre Sur Le Glacier de Vorderaar Canton de Berne Province Amsterdam 1785.Today worldwide glaciers were studied and monitored as climate proxies and the recent measurements show that almost all of them are retreating fast The story about glaciers their influence on the landscape and their possible use to reconstruct and monitor climate is an intriguing one with many triumphs setbacks and changes of mind For centuries if not even millennia the high altitude belt of mountain ranges were a region visited and travelled by man however also haunted and forbidding places The glaciers masses of ice enclosing peaks and extending their tongues into valleys were considered the residence of mountain spirits then during the medieval times the prison of damned souls the Italian poet Dante Alighieri 1265-1321 imagined the centre of hell as a frozen wasteland and the playground of demons who from time to time send avalanches and debris flows into the valley Despite these myths there was some early insights of what glaciers actually really are made the Greek historian and geographer Strabo 63 23 describes a voyages trough the Alps during the reign of Augustus and mentions there is no protection against the large quantities of snow falling and that form the most superficial layers of a glacier It a common knowledge that a glacier is composed by many different layers lying horizontally as the snow when falling and accumulating becomes hard and crystallises However the knowledge got lost and was only rediscovered during the Renaissance Leonardo da Vincis 1452-1519 is considered one of the greatest he studied anatomy biology and geology however regarding the glaciers of the Alps his ideas were somehow confused the thought glaciers were formed by not melted hail accumulating through the summer But soon the study of nature experiences an incredible raise and glaciers find place in various descriptions of travelling 1538 and 1548 glaciers were labelled even if not depicted with the term Gletscher on topographic maps of Switzerland In his account on the Swiss land the Theologian Josias Simler in 1574 describes the first historic depiction of a glacier is considered the of the Vernagtferner in the tztaler Alps from 1601 The Vernagtferner was a glacier that repeatedly dammed up the named after the which outbursts caused heavy damage and loss of property particularly in the years 1600 1678 1680 1773 1845 1847 and 1848 In 1642 the Swiss editor Matthaeus Merian the Older in his Topographie Helvetiae Rhaetiae et Valesiae published various copper engravings of glaciers and in 1706 Johann Heinrich Hottinger is interested to explain the motion of the mountains of ice in his Descriptio Montium Glacialium Helveticorum Johann Jakob Scheuchzer visiting in the year 1705 the Rhne Glacier published his observations of the true nature of the springs of the river Rhne in the opus Itinera per Helvetiae alpinas regiones facta annis 1702-1711 and confirms the idea that glaciers are formed by the accumulation of snow and they move and The description of the Rhone glacier according to Scheuchzers Itinera per Helvetiae alpinas regiones facta annis 1702-1711 the engraving shows the false springs at the mountain Furca M N O left and right of the picture and the true springs J K L coming from the snout of the great glacier surrounded by the small glacier G H The increasing interest to study glaciers in the Alps is also encouraged by enthusiastic travel reports in his Voyage pittoresque aux glaciers the Bordier of 1773 describes the Bosson glacier as a huge marble ruins of a devastated city naturalist Horace Benedict de Saussure 1740-1799 is fascinated by the mountains of his homeland he climbed mountains around Geneva since 1758 and after 1760 he travelled more than 14 times trough the Alps considering the possibilities in this time an extraordinary achievement Between 1767 to 1779 the first volume of his Voyages dans les Alpes is published were he reassumes his observations and theories about the visited glaciers he recognized moraines and large boulders as the debris accumulated by the glacier tongue and proposes to map them to interfere the former extent of glaciers Despite this exact statement de Saussure failed to connect large boulders found in the foreland of the mountains to the glaciers of the Alps He assumed that these rocks were transported on their recent locations by an immense flood That seemed to explain why most of the boulders found scattered around the plains of Germany came in first place from the regions of Scandinavia where the same lithology where found in the crystalline continental basement like Precambrian metamorphic rocks and paleozoic sediments The theory worked lesser to explain the foreland Alpine rocks to transport boulders from the Alps the flood at least had to reach 1000 of idea of a flood as the explanation for glacial deposits became largely accepted it seemed to fit the description of the biblical flood even Lyell and Darwin assumed that huge erratic boulders were transported by swimming ice drafts on top of a flood glaciers could propagate far out of their valleys was however not an unusual idea for local inhabitants who observed and experienced the growth and recess of glaciers In academic circle this approach was a little more difficult A contest thought to demonstrate the former extension of Swiss glaciers initiated by the Swiss pastor Jakob Samuel Wyttenbach in 1781 maybe inspired be the advance of the Alpine glacier in 1770 did arise any interest Could it be proven to ourselves on the available documentation that both by the progress of our ice mountains as by our misbehaviour once for pasture most suitable land is currently covered by ice There were only careful speculations considering a former expansion of glacier the geologists James Hutton 1726-1797 and his friend John Playfair 1748-1819 speculated about glaciations of the northern hemisphere In 1826 a publication by the Danish mineralogist and mountain climber Jens Esmark 1763-1839 was translated into English in this paper Jesmark discussed the possibilities that glaciers where much greater in the past then today Forbes and Robert Jameson who were the geology professors of Charles Darwin at Edinburgh University Darwin in his autobiography of 1876 remembers The sole effect they produced on me was the determination never as long as I lived to read a book on Geology or in any way to study the science discussed glacial theories during their lectures And even Buckland who still in 1831 argued northern region of the earth seems to have undergone successive changes from heat to cold in 1837 was converted to Lyell uniformatism and considered that sudden changes like an ice age and glacier expansion simply do happen in 1815 Jean Pierre Perraudin a chamois hunter in the Val de Bagnes told to the engineer Ignatz Venetz his theory that the glaciers once covered the entire valley and Venetz mapped features that made him even recognize that once the entire Swiss was covered by ice Vernetzs lecture on the assembly of the Swiss association for natural history in 1829 found little interest only Jean de Charpentier director of the salt mine in the city of Bex Western Swiss who 14 years earlier had meet and discussed with Perraudin this time accepted and got interested in this begun a detailed mapping project and in 1834 Charpentier presented again before the Swiss association the results of his investigations but the flood theory had still much supporter One of the critics in the public was a former student of Charpentier named Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz respected palaeontologist by the establishment Charpentier invited Agassiz to visit the city of Bex and surrounding mountains and to observe the following year 1837 Agassiz held an enthusiastic lecture about glaciers ice ages and ice shields and in 1840 published a detailed study of modern glaciers their deposits and their spurs in his Etudes sur les glaciers Agassiz experienced the same scepticism as many other proponents before I think that you should concentrate your moral and also your pecuniary strength upon this beautiful work on fossil fishes In accepting considerable sums from England you have so to speak contracted obligations to be met only by completing a work which will be at once a monument to your own glory and a landmark in the history of science No more ice not much of echinoderms plenty of fish Alexander von Humboldt in a letter to Agassiz on December 1837 However Agassiz had good connections to the most important geologist of his time Soon he could persuade William Buckland and later Charles Lyell After that the most respected geologist gets convinced the rest as always is history advice never try persuade ye world of a new theory persuade or of ye tip top men ye rest will go with ye stream as Dr did with Sir Davy and Wollaston in case of Kirkdale Cave Edward Jackson about an advice given by his professor Buckland in 1832 Reconstruction of the glacier that filled the valley of Amarin southern Vosges France probably the first tentative reconstruction of an ice age glacier from COLLOMB 1847 Preuves de lexistence danciens glaciers dans les valles des Vosges Agassiz research on the established the foundations of glaciology he recorded the dimension of the glacier his velocity and even ventured inside the glacier by passing trough a glacial mill Soon after 1850 the measurements methods introduced by Agassiz were carried out on various glaciers of the Alps and repeated nearly every The in the centre of the picture left and the glacier drawing by Schmetzer 1891 the is one of the

onward a general trend of recession of glaciers in the Alps is observable This trend has experienced a strong increase in the last 50 years causing concern for the fast change in the landscape the destabilisation of the rock walls once supported by the melting glaciers and the alteration of the discharge and hydrology of mountain Temperature rise in the Alps and length loss of the glaciers of the tztaler Alps western Austria in the period 1900-2010 The valley glaciers with their tongues extending in the valleys showed the strongest retreat and degradation of the studied Austrian glaciers

There is high water in the Colorado River this summer and our first hike of the trip was 50 meters downstream from the I had never hiked to this view of the river from the left bank The Vermilion Cliffs rise in the background Note the old Mormon road next to the river this is where the wagons would approach the ferry site 

Barrier islands are exposed to the open ocean and the waves and storm surges generated by hurricanes said Bob Morton a geologist at the Geological Survey Center for Coastal and Watershed Studies in Petersburg As a storm makes landfall they the ones that are going to receive the strongest winds and the highest wave actions Barrier islands like Galveston are particularly vulnerable to storm damage because they are made of sand as opposed to the hard bedrock that underlies larger islands and the mainland They also tend to have very low elevations making it easy for water to wash over and submerge the island Many have questioned the wisdom of choosing to build on and develop barrier islands given their risks Every year there reporting on the foolishness of building on barrier islands but people are going to do it anyway Morton told LiveScience We do learn from the past If you look at the barrier islands on the Mississippi coast in particular after both Hurricane Camille in 1969 and Katrina what did they do They rebuilt It a perfect example of a coastal area that did get hit as bad as it can get and they just go back and rebuild Barrier islands tend to be even riskier places to live than coastal areas because they bear the brunt of any approaching storm impact If you think about their location they basically lonely sentinels that serve as barriers for the mainland said Clark Alexander a marine geologist at Georgia Skidaway Institute of Oceanography Basically you in a vulnerable spot because you located where you get the first effects of anything coming in off the ocean Setting up residence in these vulnerable spots is particularly perilous From a safety standpoint it silly Alexander said Because the lifespan of a typical house is something like 60 years But if you live on a barrier island you ca guarantee you have land under your house in 60 years It trying to put something permanent in a place thats very dynamic As a result of Hurricane Katrina a number of barrier islands off the Mississippi coast were completely wiped off the map Even when storms are enough to raze islands completely barriers often suffer severe damage from storms The 1989 Hurricane Hugo wreaked massive havoc on Pawleys Island in South Carolina Isles Dernieres off the coast of Louisiana was devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 Often after these storms people move back and set themselves up for disaster again George Island on Apalachicola Bay off the Florida coast has been washed away five or six or eight times and people just keep building back their houses Alexander said For many people living on barrier islands there is no amount of structural support that can ward off the worst It important to note that in the big storms the category or hurricanes it really does matter how your building is said Orrin Pilkey a professor emeritus of geology at Duke University of homes on barrier islands And it does matter whether you have a seawall or not The chances are pretty good that if you have beachfront property it history 

A couple of years ago one of the great pleasures of my red Ford Mustang California dreamin road trip was a guided tour of the spectacular Oceano dunes by an enthusiast for and expert on this sea of sand I have kept in touch with Kevin and recently received links to some videos that he has been working on I started watching and my jaw dropped they are extraordinary I plan that this will be the first of a series of posts enjoying these movies but to start I have selectedone that I find quite mesmerising This is five minutes of closely observed moving sand grains in exquisite detail lit by the sun the soundtrack the wind and the hurtling grains I do appreciate that not everyone would find five minutes of moving sand mesmerising but I would venture that folk who read this blog might well So go to this link crank it up to and HD if your connection will permit maybe make some popcorn because as Kevin notes it will remind you of the action in the movie sit back and enjoy http Fast and furious eh action the thrill of the chase the endless conflicts Now if you feel so inclined go back to my post on Ralph Bagnold The man who figured out how deserts then check out Splashing around on the latter I talk about saltation and Bagnolds work on the movement of sand the way in which the wind causes grains to skip and leap in graceful but frenetic and attenuated parabolic trajectories crashing into their colleagues and sending them in turn on their way This is the mechanism by which huge amounts of sand move long distances in the wind and inducesthe other mechanism surface creep or reptation Saltating grains plummet to the surface and knock others along Watch the video again andnote the wonderful way in which both of these processes are captured the sunlight picking up the ballistics of the saltating grains and the the busy rushing crowd of their reptating friends Bagnold illustrated hiswind tunnel work and the process of saltation with the following figure from his enduring classic The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes reproduced by permission of Stephen Bagnold This is precisely what you can watch in glorious technicolour in Kevins video But a word of warning filming blowing sand destroys cameras Here is Kevins dismantled and carefully diagrammed in the hopes of removing the penetrative grains As he writes Sand and particulates packed all the buttons to where you could even press them and even worked inside the lens and between the sandwiched polarizer elements as well Tiny little hooligans Ill end with a couple ofquotes from Bagnold as I watched the movie I found it difficult to avoid the sensation of sand as a living thing a communal organism on the move with a purpose In spite of his fundamentally scientific and empirical approach Bagnold also saw something lyrical organic and alive in the moving dunes with the atmosphere of instability and continual impending movement they suggestedwaves that ought to heave but remained still day after day breakers just going to break but waiting motionless till suddenly unloosed by a gale to overwhelm the intruder worms whose notched segments one expected to see starting a concertina motion And One had a feeling that something was still going on that the old Gorgon of the myths in destroying all forms of life as we know it had but freed the sand to organise itself into these huge forms and that a creeping movement slow but inexorable was taking place even as we were among them In 1929 and 1930 during my weeks of travel over the lifeless sand sea in North Africa I became fascinated by the vast scale of organization of the dunes and how a strong wind could cause the whole dune surface to flow scouring sand from under ones feet Here where there existed no animals vegetation or rain to interfere with sand movements the dunes seemed to behave like living things Thanks Kevin 

Sand for sale environment ravaged By DENIS GRAY Associated Press Round a bend in Cambodia Tatai River and the virtual silence of a tropical idyll turns suddenly into an industrial nightmare Lush jungle hills give way to a flotilla of dredgers operating 24 hours a day scooping up sand and piling it onto barges The waters and fuel discharges villagers say have decimated the fish so vital to their livelihoods Riverbanks are beginning to collapse and the din and pollution are killing a promising ecotourism industry What is bad news for the poor remote Tatai community is great tidings for Singapore the wealthy that is expanding its territory by reclaiming land from the sea Sand from nearby countries is the prime landfill and also essential building material for Singapore spectacular skyline As more countries ban its export to curb environmental damage entire Indonesian islands have been all but wiped off the map suppliers to Singapore scour the region for what still can be obtained legally or not Cambodia a poor country where corruption is rife and laws are often flouted is now the No source Singapore is by no means the only nation taking part in what is a global harvest of sand from beaches rivers and seabeds Officials and environmentalists from China to Morocco have voiced concern and urged curbs As construction booms in emerging economies and more sources dry up however exploitation of the remaining ones is likely to intensify Sand mining began anew in May on southwestern Tatai River which empties into the ocean almost directly north of Singapore across 1,300 kilometers 800 miles of open water Despite denials by the main owner of sand mining rights in Koh Kong province two Cambodian officials told The Associated Press that the sand is destined for the island nation Singapore will not say where its sand comes from the Construction and Building Authority said it is not public information The National Development Ministry said the state infrastructure development company buys it from a diverse range of approved sources The mining visible on the Tatai River clearly violates some of Cambodia own legal restrictions not to mention a recent government order to suspend it temporarily Vessels of a Vietnamese company were tracked by boat from about 10 kilometers miles upriver to the Gulf of Thailand where nearly a dozen seagoing barges tugs hovering around them took on the sand The AZ Kunming Singapore a 5,793-ton 5,255-metric ton barge pulled by the AZ Orchid was seen arriving empty from the open ocean its tug flying a Singaporean flag Both are registered with the Singapore government which would not comment on the barge cargo or destination Ships from several countries including China were spotted in operations in Koh Kong province where residents joked about going to Singapore and planting a Cambodian flag there The vessels included one from Winton Enterprises a Hong group that was subcontracted to export sand to Singapore according to Global Witness a environmental group that published a detailed account of the trade last year The report said that miners had penetrated protected mangrove estuary and sea grass areas breeding grounds for marine life along a coastline and hinterland harboring some of the country last wilderness areas Cambodia cabinet spokesman Siphan Phay who was investigating the issue in Koh Kong appeared angry that the temporary halt order was being ignored He described the activity as illegal mining destined for Singapore a surprising statement given that government ministers awarded the concession A police officer in the economic crime division who demanded anonymity given the issue sensitivity also said the sand is going to Singapore Ly Yong Phat who holds the major concession in Koh Kong has at times openly acknowledged the Singapore connection But in a recent AP interview amid tightening restrictions and mounting criticism he said his company had not shipped sand to Singapore for more than a year because our sand did not meet their standards The dredging he added was for local sale and to deepen river channels However a Malaysian company Benalec Holdings said it was ready to tap up to 530,000 tons for a reclamation project in Singapore from several sources in Cambodia including Ly Yong Phat LYP Group Known as the King of Koh Kong Ly Yong Phat is one of Cambodia biggest tycoons and a senator with close ties to Prime Minister Hun His holdings include hotels a casino and agricultural plantations Land reclamation has enlarged Singapore by more than a fifth and up to 100 square kilometers nearly 40 square miles more are slated for reclamation by 2030 What was once seabed is now Changi among the world finest airports and more recently the Marina Bay complex which includes a 2,560-room hotel and casino developed by Las Vegas Sands Mountains of sand are needed for such fills statistics show Singapore imported 14.6 million tons last year ranking it among the world top customers Global Witness estimated that nearly 800,000 tons a year worth some 248 million were streaming to Singapore from Koh Kong alone The figures show that Cambodia supplied 25 percent of Singapore imports in 2010 followed by Vietnam Malaysia Myanmar and the Philippines With its secrecy and lax enforcement of environmental regulations Myanmar could emerge as a major supplier The damage caused by sand extraction has spurred clampdowns on exports Malaysia imposed a ban in 1997 though the media there frequently report on massive smuggling into neighboring Singapore Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad complains that sand pirates are digging Malaysia and giving her to other people An Indonesian ban came in 2007 following years of strained relations with Singapore over the sand on islands lying between the two countries When miners finished with Nipah Island reportedly all that was left was three or four palm trees protruding above the waterline Environmental groups say smuggling is believed to be continuing Vietnam banned exports late last year Cambodia outlawed the export of sand from rivers in 2009 but allows it from some seabeds Recently some government officials said that rivers where seawater flowed into fresh water replenishing sand naturally were exempt Global Witness spokesman Oliver Courtney said the trade in Cambodia revealed a mismatch between Singapore reliance on questionably sourced sand and its position as a leader for sustainable development The prides itself on environmentally sound urban planning The dredging of the Tatai River began on May 17 with a fury creating a veritable traffic jam on the water said Janet Newman owner of the riverside Rainbow Lodge Before you could see crab pots bobbing in the river everywhere and fishermen going out Now there is nothing and nobody the British woman said Chea Manith of the Nature Tourism Community of Tatai said 270 families along the river have seen an estimated 85 percent drop in catch of fish crab and lobsters and were being forced to eke out a living from small garden plots Tourists have all but vanished Armed with a petition village leaders tourism operators and a wildlife group met with Ly Yong Phat in early July He appeared sympathetic Newman said He substantially reduced the dredging and has promised to stop altogether in October A subsequent letter from the Minister of Water Resources and Meteorology ordered the LYP group to halt operations temporarily on the Tatai citing a breach of regulations The letter was obtained by Cambodia Phnom Penh Post newspaper which made it available to the AP Hun Sen himself expressed concern over the mining in the river We hoped that the prime minister recent promise to review the impacts of the sand trade would lead to proper regulation of dredging operations said Courtney of Global Witness Unfortunately the pledge does not appear to have been followed up with meaningful action The mining has continued on the Tatai and violations such as dredging closer than 150 meters 165 yards from riverbanks were clearly evident The Post also obtained a Ministry of Industry Mining and Energy letter extending LYP Group concession in Koh Kong until 2012 We are just little people We can not do anything Chea Manith said Newman sounded a more optimistic note It my hope that the LYP Group will become sympathetic through this experience of having seen the reaction from people passionate about protecting their environment she said It would be sad if they just went somewhere else to dump the same on others 

A large sinkhole some 70m deep has appeared in the ground swallowing two buildings during a heavy storm in Guatemala City Following more than 1000mm of rainfall in a single storm event many instances of flooding and local landslides were also reported It is likely that the sinkhole formed from dissolution of limestone over thousands of years was infilled with sediment which was washed away as a result of the storm The link above goes to a clip of the sinkhole on the BBC web image is from http There are some other spectacular images at http 

In the Hunza Valley Pakistan a large landslide on 4th January this year blocked the valley with the potential to produce a very large and hazardous lake The initial landslide killed 19 and displaced 250 families Since then attempts have been made to construct spillways to limit the volume of the lake which is now about 20km long and 100m deep in places 25,000 people have been evacuated by boat from the upper valley The lake volume increased slowly in the winter but in May with the onset of summer and much melt water the lake has increased rapidly in volume Evacuation of 18 villages to 30m above river level is underway and warning sirens installed to aid last minute evacuation The situation is extremely hazardous as the lake may now overflow within days The exact size of the possible flood is obviously unknown but some estimate that it may exceed the 30m planned evacuation level A web search for Hunza Valley Landslide gives a large amount of extra information 

On 6th May 2008 95m high cliffs along a 400m wide section of World Heritage Coast between Lyme Regis and Charmouth collapsed This stretch of coast is no stranger to landsliding and comprises a similar range of weak shales and marls as much of the Isle of Wight also subject to frequent landslide activity Long term inundation from prolonged summer and winter rainfall produces high pore water pressures that contribute to instability and such events can be expected to become more frequent with more the extreme weather associated with climate change Video footage of the slide can be seen at the BBC web site http and a Google Earth image of the coast affected is available at http

The Tsho Rolpa glacial lake in the high Nepalese Himalayas has been carefully monitored for a number of years The lake is constrained by a moraine dam which is vulnerable to ground movements from landslides glacier falls and seismic activity and from melting of ice blocks contained within it The glacial outburst flood that could potentially result from a breach of the moraine dam would reach villages as far as 100km downvalley Subsequent water shortages would have severe effects on the Ganges as well as Nepal The glacier which feeds Tsho Rolpa has receded rapidly over the last 10 years a function of global warming and the lake grows in length by 100m each year Controlled lake drainage via an artificial outlet channel ensures that water levels are gradually being reduced but not at a sufficient rate to reduce pressure on the moraine Nepal has 17 similar glacial lakes which have no control measures in place Further information can be found at http The image shows a small lake at Hoffelsjokull in Iceland

I am flying home from Europe in late August with nothing but a notebook and the 2011 Goldschmidt conference Geology giveaway issue to keep me occupied Using the method of reading and writing on paper I will blog my way through the compilation of highlighted geochemistry papers as time allows These will then be posted via time delay to keep the blog moving while preventing paper dinosaurs are still alive This was the conclusion reached by a group of my fellow undergrads way back in the Pliocene when I was in college As an independent study project they investigated all the possible effects of a giant meteorite impact dust fires tsunami etc and concluded that none of these effects had the reach or duration to cause widespread global the actual kill mechanism is generally armwaved hyperbolized no sunlight for months scorching acid rain death from the skies under the circular reasoning that since everything died these effects must have been lethal Understanding how entire niches get wiped out as actually rather Kump et al 2005 who described a possible kill mechanism poisoning from massive releases of gas from an the absence of oxygen bacteria will happily metabolize sugars by turning sulfate into sulphide S with the oxygen liberated form the sulfate used to burn sugar into In the absence of iron or other base metals this sulphide becomes in an aqueous system like the ocean The ocean is full of sulfate it is the second most common dissolved salt anion after chloride So under conditions generating significant amounts of is easy Once this mixed with water it oxidizes back into salfate Water with significant content is called Euxinic While the modern ocean is well oxidized throughout all but a few closed basins like the Black Sea in the geologic past some or all of the deep water may have been their study Kump et al 2005 do two things First they determine the conditions under which waters can upwell to the surface faster than oxygenated water can break down the This is important because oxygen and hydrogen sulphide react easily in water but if the exolves into the atmosphere then it can metastably with gas in the second thing that Kump et al 2005 do is to chemically model what happens to this once it gets into the atmosphere how it is broken down and what other changes occur as a result Because and do not directly react under normal atmospheric conditions oxidation in the atmosphere in generally performed by the OH and O radicals which are in turn generated by the UV or radiological breakdown of and molecules These are the same radicals that breakdown methane carbon monoxide CO and many other metastable Kump et al 2005 find is that if the flux into the atmosphere exeeds the present flux by about a factor of 1000 then the accumulates after than the OH and O radicals can break it down This leads to a step function increase in atmospheric lifetime and concentration and a drop in O and OH depletion of O and OH in turn reduced methane breakdown so that methane concentrations and mean atmospheric lifetimes also increase In addition the lack of O means that ozone production is curtailed so the ozone layer is reduced The combination of reduced ozone protection and direct toxicity is touted by Kump et al as a highly effective kill mechanism especially for land creatures and sea creatures in the waters Kump et al then go on to show that there is evidence for anoxic waters reaching the surface during a number of Phanerozoic extinction events and further hypothesize that the widespread euxinia in the Proterozoic inhibited the development of land life as a sort of permanent extinction event condition that persisted for most of Earths history until mysteriously disappearing in the kill mechanism catchily coined as a chemocline upward excursion is way outta my field of expertise So I dont know if there are reasons outside of my knowledge base to reject it out of hand However the nice thing about this paper is that it proposes a mechanism with specific testable effects which we analysts can go looking for While determining and methane levels could be a bit tricky the study of paleoeuxinity is a significant and ongoing field of study I dont know if this paper has withstood the test of time but I suspect that it has inspired a whole slew of clever experiments What more could we ask of the theoriticians Kump Pavlov Arthur 2005 Massive release of hydrogen sulfide to the surface ocean and atmosphere during intervals of oceanic anoxia Geology 33 DOI 10.1130/G21295.1

To sum up my view on the whole thing Pimental and Hamza 2011 identify some tantalizing evidence that there might be some lateral mobility in the groundwater deep in the Amazon Basin and that this water might discharge into the open ocean at the mouth of the river This was based on a bunch of 1-D well log models of flow velocities extrapolated over the whole area of the basin and not on any sort of tracer study or more complicated modelling The amount of water discharged is inferred to be the value of the Amazon River discharge which is nothing to sneeze at but this is going to need a LOT more data to validate such a conclusion For some reason the authors decide to name tiny little blebs of water squishing along through interstitial pores a River which is wrong and terribly confusing to people who are already shockingly ignorant about how the earth works 

The whole thing makes me mad but now when you search Amazon River on the Googles you going to be faced with a bullshit story about a second River without any attempt by any of the journalists to point out that well you know water might be moving underground and all but it sure as shit ai a river and it certainly ai on the goddamn scale of the you know ACTUAL RIVER sittin up there on the surface My prediction you will never hear about this work again because future work is going to DRASTICALLY reduce the actual discharge estimates from the groundwater 

This sort of thinking carries over into how people think about resources if their water has ever been in contact with sewage it contaminated irrevocably which gives rise to the completely rad phrase used in the study of conceptual sewage Even more interesting was what the study found in regards to people view on preferred water resources Given the choice people would rather have water from a river or aquifer than from treated sewage despite the fact that water in rivers or aquifers has through a matter of course at some point been in contact with something system Unless we start synthesizing water directly from volcanic gases or from the atomic furnaces of stars you are going to be free of the historical fact that at some point someone or something pissed in your water supply So why does that bother people

This will be a brief field trip report from an undisclosed place and an undisclosed time In fact other such field trips over the years whether during or after work might be worth reporting on occasionally mostly sans was a sunny afternoon approaching early evening and several colleagues and I passed by some broken and brecciated road cuts while on the way to our various evening destinations wherever they might have been The purpose of the rather spontaneous mini field trip was to shoot the bull about the meaning of the road cuts and see if we could figure anything outin other words to get our creative thoughts flowing Lines and crude were drawn in the dirt on the side of the road with less crude versions drawn in some field first stop was essentially a mess of fractured broken and shattered rocks showing varying degrees of and oxidation Some weakly clayey limestones formed a possibly arched upper zone above more typically dark gray Devonian limestone cut by hematitic seams and hematitic fines Discussions ensued about what were staining the rocks and filling in fractures A reddish colorationreddish brown to reddish orange brownin a batch of rocks sometimes present in broad areas or even over whole mountains is supposed to be a good sign when one is looking for the upper oxidized to leached portion of a porphyry copper system at least according to a few oldtimers who told me about such things back in the late 1970s when porphyry copper exploration had come to a standstill after what turned out to be a decline in the price of Aside A long time ago Bear Creek or Minefinders developed a color triangle for determining the composition of various limonites or generic to mixed Powdered pure or nearly pure jarosite a sulfate containing iron that can form as a weathering or oxidation product of pyrite was placed in a circlular spot in the upper corner of the triangle powdered pure goethite was placed in the lower left corner of the triangle and powerdered pure hematite was placed in the lower right corner of the triangle Three other circles were placed between the three corners each composed of 50-50 mixes of the appropriate two of the three main powders and one circle in the center contained the three end members mixed together To summarize the triangles main colors jarosite is pale yellow to white when powdered or scratched goethite is the typical dark golden brown of the average limonite and hematite is its typical reddish brown I looked high and low for an online version of this field cheat sheet that consisted of stiff cardboard with clear or circles of powders with appropriate labeling but have yet to find anything resembling the original Perhaps I draw up something similar to the original and go further into this little exercise in crude field determinations sometime at a later date For now back to the field developed a question or two as we were standing beneath the large fractured to brecciated mass of structurally complex reddish to yellowish brown pile of carbonate rocks were we looking for copper and does the same guide to ore red rocks and reddish color anomalies also apply to finding porphyry molybdenum deposits I also wondered have red rocks been considered a guide to ore in at least some disseminated gold districts for example at and around Florida Canyon The answers maybe seriously what we were looking for was actually in question and it is good to define what you are looking for without getting so stuck on what you decided to look for that you ca see the possibility of finding something else yes for sure something I first learned from other types also back in the late 1970s and well of course but not impromptu field trip then moved down the road to stop number two where a breccia of unknown origin was exposed in a particularly hairy road cut on a tight curve with narrow shoulder and the occasional speeding vehicle The breccia reminded me of the Titus Canyon megabreccia mostly angular fragments of carbonate rock were cemented by white crystalline calcite I thought it looked like a breccia of possible hydrothermal origin one in which fragments had shattered but not moved far It also looked a bit like a tectonic breccia though no faulting surfaces were exposed The expounder leading this part of our field trip said it could be a collapse breccia that formed over an oxidized massive sulfide deposit Oxidation of sulfides produces volume loss leaving a potential collapse waiting to happen I not sure how the calcite gets into position to cement the breccia together it somehow having to push the fragments apart to exploit the collapsed zone but some long thin beds of shaly limestone could be seen to be sagging downward in a couple places testifying to possible collapse Perhaps the breccia was really fragment supported instead of apparently matrix supported in which case the calcite could have moved in later with groundwater or low temperature hydrothermal waters of some major questions arose from the two field trip stops and all the bull that was being shot around One major one that was oft repeated Should we drill here Or there Or over there Everyone wanted to choose their own drill hole or two and locate them in specific favored spots Another question Should we sample here The answer to that question If you have to ask the question and do just pile in with your bags labels and rock hammers the answer is an automatic yes Conclusion get on with it so ended a spontaneous early evening field trip to two undisclosed field trip stops

This afternoon I found myself in a conversation where once again I described myself as not terribly Nearly every time this comes up people express surprisehow can I not be goal oriented and yet have a PhDis that achievement only possible if one is driven to achieve a fairly major goal The answer is that no that is not the only way to get that degree Certainly many who have one are goal oriented and used that goal as the driving force for all of the work that is required but not me In my case I went to University because I loved learning and had so much fun in high school that I wanted it to continue For me there was never a question of what kind of job will this degree get you later but only the question of what cool things do I wish to study now The beauty of my approach is that one gets to ask that question over and over again each time one registers for a new term and each time the answers will be slightly different What got me to move on from undergraduate classes to graduate school was the discovery that someone would pay me to be a student This sounded much better than paying to spend my time learning things so I completed my Bachelor degree and enrolled first as a Master student and later as a PhD student Once I enrolled in graduate school I did work towards completing the degree but not because I was driven by the goal of obtaining the degree but because when someone else is paying for my education it comes with a certain obligation of actually doing well in my classes with the Masters and the research both Master and PhD Besides both programs came with a offer on their fundingthe rules of the game were clearyour funding runs out after a certain number of years and you have a choiceget the degree by then or go without I may not be goal oriented but I do have a fairly strongly developed sense of responsibility and if my part of the bargain for the free education is to complete the degree well yes I do have what it takes to do it 

One year after the monsoon flooding that devastated Pakistan in July 2010 Merlin is still working tirelessly to meet the many health challenges faced by the Pakistani people Ismael Babar had to flee from his home when the floods struck last year When he returned the floods had washed away his crops leaving him and his nine children with nothing to eat Im old now and Ive seen a lot but Ive never seen anything like the floods last year We lost everything the flood washed away our crops and we are left with nothing 

Merlin has scaled up existing operations in northern Pakistan as fears rise that waterborne diseases could exacerbate the situation following last week severe flooding Merlin has more than 300 medical experts responding to the emergency which is Pakistan worst flooding in decades Our teams are on the ground now in some of the worst affected areas including Swat Valley and Nowshera district Marinella Bebos Merlin operations manager said With water supplies contaminated and an estimated 

Portugal is going through a severe financial and economic crisis You can read all about it in the press national and international and I promise you this post is not about that But concerning this subject is very easy to read about the imminent fatal catastrophe that willinexorablefall upon all our heads if we dont behave now I really have to restrain myself from discussing what behave means from defending the European social security system that the same guys that caused the crisis say is not possible to sustain etc again this post is not about that It is about what I call the anthropocentric character of all these opinions the inability of the vast majority of the well educated opinion makers to remember or I suspect in most cases to realize that our species as has happened with all the others in our planet within a very brief interval of geological time will almost for sure disappear What I mean is that all geologists know that Homo sapiens sapiens will briefly in geological terms most probably be extinct For those of you who are less familiar with geological time a very small list of dates to trigger your interest this is a super super summarized list of important events most Cosmologists say the Universe started with the Big Bang at 15 000 million years The age of the Earth corresponds closely to one third of that time 4600 million years The first forms of life prokaryotes are generally thought to have appeared on the Earth between 3000-4000 million years Multicellular organisms did not exist until ca 610 million years and Modern man Homo sapiens sapiens biped apes with big brains that love to use instruments are only around since 200 000 years the lack of the word million after the number is not a mistake If youre not a geologist take a break to think about these numbers Compare 200ky with 100My that corresponds approximately to the time of dominance of dinosaurs on the Earth Take your time think about it How do you feel Getting a grip of how hugely insignificant we are in geological terms now Take it easy were not extinct yet and mean while I recommend the use of a small parcel of the time we have left to read the beautiful book by Jan Zalasiewicz The Earth After Us What legacy will humans leave in the rocks an offer from an aunt of mine that lives in Toronto who has paid me a visit in Lisbon a few weeks ago left Jan Zalasiewicz photo from here The book uses as an excuse to explain the geology of our planet the premise of an intelligent alien civilization finding Earth one hundred million years from now long after our extinction as a species and their efforts to learn about our planet through reading its history on the rocks What impact would we have left What impression would we have made What would be our legacy in the eyes of these alien guys The book which was first published in 2008 many of you might have read it already is not a science fiction book make no mistake about it Although its main premise is speculative enough alien civilization finding our planet etc it functions merely as a pretext to explain with unbelievable simplicity some major concepts of modern geology How and why is an important parcel of the history of our planet preserved in the strata How rare is this compared with other solar system planets What is plate tectonics and why does it exist on Earth and not on Venus or Mars What are the implications of this for the existence of life These are all examples of interesting discussed topics always contemplated with the concern of making sophisticated concepts accessible to everyone with a curious mind one of the most productive ways to shake the depressive feeling arising from realizing our nevertheless quite obvious finitude as a species Then again we are the product of thousands of millions of years of evolution One strange product since in our case through such an evolution matter has acquired at least some degree of consciousness of itself and of its surroundings There is absolutely no precedent in the history of the Earth and elsewhere in the Universe So maybe just maybe this will make a difference and one hundred million years from now we will be exploring other stars At least thats what I like to think about it when I look at my kids

The conversation kicked off with this tweet from Jarrett followed by quotes from the paper Jarrett Do we think too big Personality differences PhD climate scientists and the public implications for communication http Our results demonstrate that the dominant personality types for climate change researchers are fundamentally different from those found in the population This suggests that there is a strong potential for inherent challenges in communication between these two groups As the climate change community continues to move forward with effective communication and education it is important to keep in mind that it isnt just what we say but how we say it The preference for Intuition by early career climate scientists suggests that this group is likely to be more oriented towards future climate impacts than members of the general public who generally prefer Sensing over Intuition Fig For Sensors the current situation is more relevant and more easily appreciated and past experience and concrete facts are more trusted than future possibilities Thus climate impacts beyond the present or readily foreseeable future may lack relevance among the general public Our results suggest that the research community may more effectively communicate with the general public by including the personal and local impacts of climate change in addition to more analytical results Compared to the United States population climate scientists also exhibited a strong preference for Judging on the final dichotomy Fig This suggests that on average climate change researchers will prefer to reach a decision or come to closure and move on to the next step more quickly than the general population The general population with a higher proportion of Perceivers is more likely to see room for doubt or want to take more time to explore possible alternatives especially when outcomes are not likely to be positive Jarrett These are HUGE points for us to think about as a scientific community WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOURE FRIENDS WITH A FILM SCHOLAR SCOTTS RESPONSE Scott Im sorry but I cant help myself but Im going to be a cranky humanist for a minute anyway Did you really need a trumped up personality type study to determine that folks pursuing in science think better and at a higher level of abstraction than the average American Or did you really need it to convince you that the general public can think only concretely about concerns and without being able to translate that thinking into action Just look at your students If its really a question of how it gets said then I think perhaps people who study how things get said for a living rhetoricians media scholars even marketing people in might be able to furnish better insights on how to structure communications than can be got out of multiple choice personality sorters Also I you Jarrett TTTTHHHHTTTPPPBBB heee you too Ok but really believe it or not this is NOT something we think about It is honestly baffling to 99 of us as to why communication of climate change often fails outright Largely this is because we are nose down in the trenches with this stuff it is our daily reality That something intrinsic to our could be getting in the way of something that seems obvious like a big blinking red light of shiny redness is not something that would occur The test reported on was part of DISCCRS and for my session we were all pretty surprised And then we got it And then the communications workshops from that point on from a media relations expert and a public speaking coach clicked in a way that I havent seem them do so in other science comms workshops So I think having this paper in the sci literature is invaluable and Im hoping it gets widely circulated amongst the climate community It honestly isnt something wed think of Unless you live with a playwright Then well you may hear a few things This is Scotts his words response to his response Scott I have to say Im frankly shocked that this is something you science people dont think about Really Honestly Shocked I can understand an attitude one that I frequently have concerning my own work in which the public just isnt the audience for a particular piece of research or writing that scholarly work is primarily for the consumption of other scholars But the moment it becomes a question of publicizing and not just publishing knowledge it strikes me that these sorts of observations really have to be the starting point And at that point you really ought to talk to people like me even if Im a namby pamby qualitative fake humanist scholar without spurious quantification of the sort I also know that a lot of science moves forward by quantifying things we already know but the filter by which knowledge only becomes real when it gets quantified excludes a great deal of accumulated wisdom that people like me have to share Then again at the moment the biggest problems in the way climate science gets talked about dont lie with the scientists or their communication style or personality types but rather in the media and political and economic systems And the ways in which those systems cause material things to happen or not happen in the world like raising or the concentration of in the atmosphere And when it comes to these things you have to have an analysis that allows you to talk about the ways in which knowledge passes through these systems and what happens to it along the way Which means you also have to have an analysis that includes the interfaces between these systems and between these systems and effects That is you need some kind of multisystemic knowledge which is at its heart unquantifiable in practice if not in principle Such an analysis will have to include things like how people fix their political ideas the nature of affinity group politics the way money circulates in the political systems the sorts of convictions that pass for knowledge in the world the ways in which collective action becomes possible etc So much of how humans operate looks like fuzzy logic willful ignorance and this kind of multisystemic knowledge is going to have to reflect that Theres this fallacy that if I just ride my bike to work instead of driving and buy local produce and eat less meat and use CFLs and turn the heat down and shrink my carbon footprint generally and of course I do Im doing my part But we know that any change that matters must happen at much much greater scales individual action is not sufficient or really necessary given the current organization of our economy our politics our built environment etc Real collective action is not merely the action of a large number of individuals but something greater than the sum of its parts I think theres a similar fallacy among scientists by which communicating more and better to the public about climate change will on its own have media political and economic effects that will lead to real change of the form of reducing the rate of increase stabilizing or decreasing the concentration of in the atmosphere It wont Which is to say while Im shocked that this sort of thing hasnt occurred in aggregate to scientists doing research on the effects of climate change now that Im more I also kind of dont really care All the knowledge I need from my point of view is available at this point climate change is happening its real its bad and its probably worse than our most recent estimates And also we dont know exactly whats going to happen it is unpredictable given the state of current science and may be unpredictable given the nature of the thing We need both to radically cut back carbon emissions and to fund research into the likely effects and ways to mitigate them But I dont get to set policy by fiat And thank god for that Im sure Id fuck it up royally The sort of manifold problem that climate change is requires thinking with and across not just multiple systems but multiple kinds of knowledge geology ecology biology chemistry engineering architecture economics policy media studies rhetoric political science and political theory psychology even philosophy Note that not all of these kinds of knowledge are compatible what counts as knowledge in philosophy vs chemistry And then a much messier problem what do you do when polls show that climate change denialists are also the most confident in their position the most confident that they have all the information they need to support their conclusions Im not saying I have a solution but I do know that you need a theory of the case What that theory ends up looking like depends on what you think the case at hand is and your resources for building theories From where you are I can perhaps see why the case and its theory look simple climate change is happening we can measure it and its effects theyre bad we need to stop polluting mmmkay But from this side of things the theory of the case has to be at once fiendishly complex fuzzy and partial since it includes problems from the nature of knowledge since climate denialists say that they that climate change isnt real theyre wrong but how do you remediate that problem to the design of the built environment since you cant simply rely on the goodwill of people not to drive to how to spur changes in aggregate behavior at the relevant scales since you cant also simply dictate peoples behavior by fiat et cetera and ad nauseam I know you know all this So let me put this another way since Im going on at length and seem just to be talking around the problem I think why this hit a nerve for me is that I was shocked that yall note the plural were ignorant or just ignoring a problem so small and so obvious to me Im a more than just a little worried at the failure to comprehend the problem at scalea much more difficult nut to crack And real the problem isnt the difference in personalities between and the general public although certainly that matters but rather I think the narrowness of how ordinary ecologists and geologists studying the climatic system and its effects understand the nature of the knowledge theyre producing And that my friend is not something that a personality sorter can even begin to address Jarrett I think you have just summarized the emotional and strategic development of the climate change science community over the past 15-30 years or so And fortunately these are issues that we are now well aware of and reasons for which we are thankful for people like Steve Schneider Jon Krosnick Susan Hassol and the myriad of organizations that have sprang up to teach us basic media combat What is interesting about the survey and the reactions to it is that it was given to a group of recent PhDs While some of us had begun to become armed for the realm of science and climate change communication others had not And none of us connected the changes in our communication strategies pathed on to basic personality differences Seriously we are so in this stuff and it is so obvious to us that what many of us perceive as needing to change is communication style and strategy The idea that empathy is actually a huge part of the strategy as well knowing that we need to not just pare out jargon but think completely differently in terms of how someone may perceive the exact same set of information due to something fundamental about who they are is a little more deep thinking that at least recent PhDs have gone And man was it a In fact it actually naturally helps out in a lot of the other communication barriers we need to overcome in translating science to society But no worries on the failure of comprehension and communication The communication of climate change properly with full honesty has become a huge thing The study of it and the training we now receive as scientists falls largely along many of the lines you outline The problem that you rightly identify is that we may have come to this a little late in the game as now weve gone from something that with good communication empathy and solid facts that are concrete and short term can be understood and believed by anyone with a brain to a combative place And so strategy shifts and changes It makes me thankful for some of the amazing climate communicators we have out there and hopeful that given that I have folk like you in my pocket that I can contribute something useful to the larger conversation What do you think Is this study important to helping scientists understand why no one understands them Or is it a kitten are cute kind of study that only proved the obvious Most importantly do we need to hire Scott as our consulting namby pamby qualitative fake humanist scholar Weiler Keller Olex 2011 Personality type differences between climate

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Over the course of the 2010 monsoon season Pakistan experienced the worst floods in its history Heavy rainfall flash floods and riverine floods combined to create a moving body of water equal in dimension to the land mass of the United Kingdom The floods have affected 84 districts out of a total of 121 districts in Pakistan and more than 20 million people of Pakistan population devastating villages from the Himalayas to the Arabian Sea More than 1,700 men women and children have lost their lives and at least 1.8 million homes have 

Background Pakistan is experiencing a humanitarian crisis of an unprecedented magnitude caused by the worst flash flooding in over 80 years The floods were initially confined to Balochistan however the rains quickly spread to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KPK and later to Sindh and Punjab provinces While the rains have diminished or ceased in certain areas the prospect of further downpours can not be ruled out especially in southern Punjab and Sindh provinces Furthermore the overflow of the River Indus has been displacing communities along its banks and has caused

Imagine an episode of The team of are investigating a case of wholescale graffiti in the middle Silurian and theyre looking for fingerprints Someone or something has taken a knife to the land and carved out a network of rivers and streams The usual suspect is quickly identified the climate In particular climates main rainfall But the suspect something more sinister with the arrival of vascular plants on the scene Could meagre plants have contributed to the river patterns This very question has been asked by geomorphologists for a while Bill Dietrich and Taylor Perron put a spotlight on the question in a 2006 Nature review article Asking if life leaves a tangible geomorphic signature their main conclusion was that natural ecosystems probably dont create any novel landforms no hillvers or gullakes just that they change the magnitude and frequency of those landforms that already can exists hills rivers gullies and lakes But the question remained How do the magitudes and frequencies change And do these changes bear a uniquely biological signature In a recent paper of mine Collins and Bras 2010 I argue that if you look at river systems from arid to humid climates you will see a uniquely biological signature In particular as arid climates give way to the number of rivers dissecting a landscape would decrease because the expanding vegetation offsets the erosion power of increasing rainfall But as climates give way to and humid rivers begin to dissect more of the landscape because the heavier rainfall now overwhelms the resistive plants This geomoprhic pattern has been observed many times but the biophysical chain of events had not been pinned down in as much detail This detail was possible because of the use of a numerical biophysical model albeit a simplified one If there is one single culprit here it is plant transpiration which fundamentally alters the landscapes water balance and thus its erosivity Despite their comparatively small stature and life expectancy then the evolution of vascular plants in the middle Silurian probably started to alter the trajectory of landform evolution and fundamentally so While I did not focus on this point in my paper it is an easy inference to make 

Okay so the house wasnt swallowed by a sarlacc But nor was it swallowed by a sinkhole as the Associated Press is telling us You may have seen the news Family killed as home swallowed up by giant sinkhole in Quebec or variations upon a theme If you look at the aerial photos youll see scars of slumped land on one side severing the road cutting across the fields in an arc But this slumped earth was not swallowed by a sinkhole to disappear under ground but simply moved sideways towards the river The river channel is now buried as is the land beside the river This is a landslide not a sinkhole Sinkholes truly are holes in which the land surface disappears into cavities below ground or when these cavities collapse causing a depression Landslides are lateral displacements of earth that occur when there isnt enough friction between the layers of soil to keep the ground in one place The ground surface slides down this surface carrying and shunting dirt and houses down with it 

Two weeks ago news hit the TV of the impact the Northland drought is having on kiwi It had already been picked up far and wide back in February but as the drought continues so does the story The story is this drought has caused nocturnal kiwi to forage for food during the day These normally nocturnal birds forage for insects in the leaf litter on a forest floor Normally But the onset of one of the most severe droughts on record has set off the collapse of a line of ecological dominoes Low rain begets low soil moisture which begets lower plant growth and harder soils which beget less food for insects and more inaccessible insects which means less food for kiwi which means more excursions by kiwi into the unsafe light of day and potentially higher mortality This game of ecological dominoes triggered by water shortfalls is seen the world over The seasonal swing to dry conditions in the Florida Everglades concentrates fish and other aquatic critters into ever smaller pools of water These pools become the fast food joints of the bird world and of bird watchers The same applies to watering holes from Africa to Australia But while this seasonal swing is par for the course in Florida a sustained climatic shift in the US Southwest that started in the 1970s caused several common animal species to go locally extinct and some rare species to increase The middle man in this case was the expansion of shrubs that fared better in the wetter winters Shrubs have deeper roots than herbaceous plants giving them a competitive advantage when more water infiltrates deeper into the soil as would occur during wetter winters Back to kiwi drought is not the number one threat that dishonour goes to introduced mammals But I imagine that the threats posed by drought would be substantially alleviated in sanctuaries where daylight foraging is less risky 

When it comes to Canterbury water governance the balance of satisfaction has shifted dramatically over the last few weeks Some are happier now that commissioners will replace elected councilors at ECan Some are not And those who are not are increasingly making themselves heard At two meetings recently the malcontents voiced their feelings from calm criticism to vociferous outrage Running through both events were the feelings of eroded trust lost democracy and endangered water There is no way I can relay every nugget of observation partly because I wasnt omnipresent But in the interests of shedding some light on the cogs between water and society here are a few First from Wednesday night Yani Johanson Christchurch City Councilor reiterated the remark that Christchurch City Mayor Bob Parker did not consult with the city council on ECans performance Indeed there appeared to be substantial tension between Mayor and Council David Sutherland ECan Councilor said No use crying over spilled milk People have to find positive things to do like getting a new mayor This view seemed to be shared by most people present Two outgoing ECan councilors are possible candidates Lianne Dalziel Labour MP saw the Creech Report as the start of a effort to undermine conservation orders Russell Norman reiterated his belief that the debate over water is a debate about who we are as a nation He also noted Bill Englishs recent statements at a Deloitte business function that the ECan Bill was passed in the interests of fostering irrigation Eugenie Sage ECan councilor remarked that there has been tension between ECan and the territorial authorities because of ECans demands regarding storm water and sewage operations The lone Mayor to join the panel Garry Jackson of Hurunui District received a lot of harsh questioning but also a lot of applause for having the guts to show up And on a social analysis of the attendees the dominant hair colour was silver and many heard about the event from a Green Party email It was a Green Party event after all A couple hundred were in attendance inside out out with a stopping to listen Turning to the Thursday night meeting this one was about what people can do from here Held in the Arts Centres Great Hall the meeting was an ideas fest Direct action was a common theme Here are some of the ideas put forward David Moorhouse Christchurch Green Party advocated a rates resistance or rates revolt The rationale being no taxation without representation The Melvin Hills Protection Society suggests a hikoi starting at rivers on either end of Canterbury to converge on Christchurchs main square Brendan Burns Labour MP presented a petition to the House of Representatives Polly Miller President of Whitewater NZ offered to give the commissioners a whitewater tour of the Hurunui River This was perhaps the suggestion with the most potential for influence water governance before the next elections Cantabrian artist Sam Mahon suggested both a vigil in the square and of possible dams And on the audience it seemed a bit more youthful than the previous night mostly this time but there was also a significant 20-something turnout Probably about 200 came 

When it comes to conversion of grassland to shrubs or trees the typical story goes like this More rainfall is caught be the foliage and evaporated straight back into the air Higher rates of transpiration deplete soil moisture faster and deeper roots inhibit drainage of water from soil to aquifer This story is typical because it is observed time and time again but it is not the whole story Nor is it always true A recent paper in Geophysical Research Letters by Bradford Wilcox and Yun Huang tells a different story They document annual streamflow for several rivers in the Edwards Plateau central Texas While the region has experienced an expansion of shrubs and trees AKA woody encroachment river flow has paradoxically increased The reason they propose is that while woody plants have expanded grazing has reduced Livestock trample and compact the soil and eat the herbaceous plants both of which reduce infiltration of water into the soil and ultimately reducing recharge of the aquifers that feed the springs But as grazing declined seems to have increased It thus seems that grazing in the Edwards Plateay has a greater impact of river flow than woody encroachment While Wilcox and Huang have started to tell a different story the story is far from over They have eliminated historical rainfall as the source of the change but they have not eliminated historical evaporative demand And while river flow has increased it seems that flow from other sources has also paradoxically increased If increased due to herbaceous plants favouring infiltration youd think surface runoff would drop accordingly but apparently not Whatever the answer the researchers are on the case and it is fair to say that another exception to the rule of land use hydrology will be found Farley Jobbagy Jackson 2005 Effects of afforestation on water yield a global synthesis with implications for policy Global Change Biology 11 10 1565-1576 DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.01011.x Wilcox Huang Y 2010 Woody plant encroachment paradox Rivers rebound as degraded grasslands convert to woodlands Geophysical Research Letters 37 DOI 10.1029/2009GL041929

So far they have raised just 40 per flood victim according to an analysis by Oxfam While the earthquake killed far more people than the floods some 70,000 caring for its survivors was a less daunting task because there were fewer of them Kashmir is a much smaller and much less densely populated area than the wide swath of Pakistan inundated by the floods The total damage caused by the floods is twice that of the quake according to estimates by the World Bank 

A video report on flooding in Pakistan and criticism of the governments response effort from Britains Channel News Five years after Islamic charities with ties to militant groups aided victims of a deadly earthquake in Pakistan earning good will as the countrys government struggled to respond reports suggest that the same scenario may be unfolding again On Monday Reuters reports that several Islamic charities are rushing to fill a vacuum created by a slow response from the Pakistani government to devastating floods that have killed hundreds and left up to million Pakistanis in need of assistance Reuters notes that one of the groups involved in the response has ties to an Islamic charity led by the founder of the banned militant group which was blamed for the 2008 attacks on the Indian city of Mumbai In October my colleague Salman Masood explained that is widely viewed as a front for A spokesman for Salman Shahid told Reuters Were very much there Were the only group that is providing cooked food to trapped people and those laying on the roadside He added that the Islamic charity had already established 13 camps for displaced people in the region and was operating six medical centers equipped with a dozen ambulances As my colleagues Jane Perlez and Pir Zubair Sah reported last year when up to two million people were displaced by fighting between government forces and the Taliban in the Swat valley and several other Islamist groups provided food medical care and transportation to those in need in the absence of effective aid from the government Swat is now one of the areas hit hardest by heavy rain and flooding According to Huma Yusuf a columnist for the Pakistani newspaper Dawn the government can not afford to stand by while the Islamists provide shelter and medical assistance to flood victims in a region of the country where the military is fighting to defeat the Taliban Writing on Sunday Yusuf called the official response to the floods so far totally inadequate She added Tragedies such as those Pakistanis have borne in the past few days the plane crash and the ravaging floods provide governments with the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for governance The failure to do so breeds conditions that allow extremism to thrive The mantra that good governance is the best antidote to extremism seems cliched But it bears repeating in Pakistan where the authorities have proved incapable of learning from history Few can forget that five years ago in the wake of the October 2005 earthquake the governments failure to cope with immediate relief efforts created a vacuum within which pulled off its greatest publicity stunt The extremist organization had the most efficient response teams on the ground and boasted the most functional and relief camps Its mobile machines and operating theaters made international headlines Through their clever use of mobile technology the groups volunteers established an unparalleled communications infrastructure that facilitated relief work The government and army meanwhile fumbled in early relief and reconstruction efforts as charges of corruption in the distribution of aid and resources were rampant The consequences of stepping in where the government should have been exercising its authority are obvious today in the support and influence that the organization enjoys This halting response to the floods comes just days after the Pakistani governments chaotic response to a plane crash near the capital Islamabad was criticized by Yusufs newspaper The Pakistani Taliban have apparently tried to capitalize on the natural disaster by blaming its victims The Press Trust of India reported that a spokesman for the militants Muhammad Umer sent an to news organizations announcing a in regions and calling the disaster a form of divine retribution on enemies of the Islamist militants 

Pakistani villagers carry their belongings through flood water following heavy monsoon rain at Golarchi town in Badin district about 200 km east of Karachi on September 13 2011 Photo Asif Hassan AFP Getty Images These days when it rains in South Asia it does just pour it floods A month of monsoon squalls has deluged hundreds of towns and villages in northwest India and Pakistan The latter has seen the most acute flooding and on all evidence has been the least prepared for it At least 233 people have already died and 300,000 are now stranded or in makeshift camps a figure that will surely grow Officials in Pakistan claim some 5.5 million people so far have been affected by rising waters That still only a fraction of the 20 million hit by last year catastrophic rains but the forecast looks ominous Neva Khan Oxfam Pakistan country director spelled out the dimensions of the crisis on the relief agency website There is an urgent need to provide immediate and life saving relief to the millions affected It has stopped raining in Sindh for the last 10 days Large swathes of land are underwater and people are desperately awaiting relief They have lost their crops homes and livestock for the second time and been pushed from last year disaster to this one Sindh the vast fertile province abutting the Arabian Sea appears the worst affected Across Pakistan some 900 villages have been wholly submerged and millions of hectares of arable land some still irrevocably damaged by last year floods are under water What most depressing about the situation now is how keenly it echoes the 2010 calamity Omar Waraich TIME Islamabad correspondent wrote this excellent piece a year ago for the magazine international editions As the waters rise Pakistan faces a familiar cocktail of maladies from last summer Then the civilian government headed by the unpopular President Asif Zardari was hampered by political infighting and its fundamental subservience to the real power of Pakistan influential military Now not much has changed though Zardari is still in his position a surprise to some Then militants and terrorists were exposing the fragility of the Pakistani state with strikes on some of country major cities Now after a rancorous summer of with the not much has changed either not least when suspected allied militants raided a prominent naval base in Karachi earlier this year Then the government pleaded for foreign assistance Now similar calls are being issued with similar notes of desperation In the weeks to come inquests will be made into whether enough had been done to shore up riverbanks provide shelter and food for the hundreds of thousands left destitute for over a year and prepare for the next season rains Already there are reports of angry civilians blockading roads like last year demanding outside intervention and aid Cities like Karachi which this summer has seen a spasm of internecine will be further strained by refugees fleeing the countryside On many levels though the disaster is not The floodplain of the great Indus river home to over 100 million people birthed one of the world first ancient civilizations But the river likely also swallowed it up Because of its own particular ecology the Indus ca be controlled by similar mechanisms of levees prevalent in the West And climate change has made weather patterns more unpredictable and BBC story from a year ago cites the research of an Indian scientist Professor Rajiv Sinha from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur who has had first hand experience of Asian river floods takes a more strident position What all the climate models predict is that the distribution of monsoon rains will become more uneven in the future he told BBC News Total rainfall stays the same but it comes in shorter more intense bursts In August 2010 more than half of the normal monsoon rain fell in only one week Typically it is spread over three months Professor Sinha remarked Rivers just ca cope with all that water in such a short time It was five times maybe 10 times more than normal So if the unusually intense 2010 monsoon is the shape of things to come and that is uncertain the future may hold more flood misery for the people of Pakistan It a closing sentence that has proven sadly prophetic

implementing the second largest US civilian assistance effort in the world USAID grapples with these challenges every day We do so because the US has a critical partnership with the government and people of Pakistan As Secretary Clinton stated last week We are prepared to stand by the Pakistani people for the long haul The United States knows that Pakistans future is imperatively important for us but even more so for the people themselves and we look toward a strong Pakistan one that is democratic one that is prosperous and stable being a cornerstone for regional stability and global security That is why the United States will continue to support Pakistans sovereignty its government and above all its people Pakistani stockbrokers are reflected in a share prices board during a trading session at the Karachi Stock Exchange KSE in Karachi on April 24 2009.The benchmark index was 7614.92 with increase a 279.20 points in middle of the day session AFP Tabassum Both Americans and Pakistanis are rightly asking how USAID will ensure a return on this investment in terms of development impact in Pakistan and regional peace and stability Our shared priorities in energy economic growth stabilization health and education are directed to addressing both short and challenges Since September 2009 USAID has disbursed over 1.7 billion in development assistance to Pakistan a substantial program that has already begun to yield substantial results USAIDs approach to Pakistan focuses on the need to promote sustainable economic growth by addressing the countrys energy crisis and raising incomes in the agricultural sector the mainstay of Pakistans economy We are also working to improve the governments capacity to deliver public goods and services such as health and education and expand the writ of the government in insecure areas Ask any Pakistani today and they will tell you about the daily blackouts often lasting 10-12 hours a day that make life difficult and business impossible percent of public schools in Pakistan have no electricity Pakistanis will also tell you about soaring food prices and destroyed livelihoods in the aftermath of last years catastrophic flooding USAID is addressing Pakistans needs in these critical sectors by using funding under the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 to rehabilitate infrastructure and improve the public sectors capacity to perform An example of USAIDs impact can be seen at Pakistans power plants and in the hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses that that will be powered thanks to infrastructure upgrades USAIDs current energy program is designed to add 540 MW to Pakistans power grid by 2012 USAID is also funding the completion of dams at Gomal Zam Satpara and Tarbela USAID helped build the Tarbela Dam in the 1970s and has just completed the first phase of a turbine rejuvenation effort When completed Gomal Zam located in South Waziristan will generate electricity for 25,000 households and irrigate 191,000 acres providing a livelihood for 30,000 households It will also improve flood control systems stemming serious damage that could be inflicted by future floods And American taxpayers do not foot this bill alone The government is providing 80 of the funding for the Gomal Zam Dam and USAID 20 Pakistani farmers pay 50 of the cost of more efficient water pumps from USAID In turn they save 30 on new electricity bills And by rehabilitating and completing existing dams and power plants rather than committing to the construction of new ones our approach is also and complements earlier investments made by the Government of Pakistan and international donors A Pakistani woman harvests wheat in Lahore on April 13 2010 As the wheat harvesting continues in full swing in Sindh province and southern Punjab its production is expected to be around 24 million tons this year AFP Ali USAID is also working to raise incomes and create jobs in the agriculture sector Pakistans agricultural sector provides 21 of GDP and currently employs 44 of the national labor force Work in this sector has become even more critical in the aftermath of unprecedented flooding that swept the country last year which affected over 20 million Pakistanis Following the floods USAID provided emergency seeds and restored lands tools and livestock ensuring continued livelihoods for 25 of the population Due to the improved wheat seed varieties provided by USAID preliminary average yields per acre are currently 60 higher than the traditional average Under current yield rates and market prices the value of the 2011 spring wheat is expected to be approximately 190 million But USAID is not only working to the meet the immediate and needs of the Pakistani people USAID is helping the government provide for the needs of its citizens sustainably and independently In energy USAID is working to reduce the need for public sector subsidies by improving commercial performance strengthening financial solvency and attracting private and international investors In agriculture we are addressing structural constraints insufficient investment over many years inappropriate policies and an impending water crisis In health and education we are working closely with our Government of Pakistan partners to support policy reforms and improve systems that are currently failing to adequately meet the countrys demand for basic services USAID works vigorously to ensure that its investments are effective sustainable and accountable We dont spend for the sake of spending and have delayed or cancelled programs when necessary How does USAID know that it can achieve these ambitious objectives It already has USAID has been working in Pakistan since it became an agency in the 1960s Several of Pakistans hallmark development successes the Green Revolution Lahore University of Management Sciences LUMS and Tarbela Dam are all part of USAIDs legacy 

By Amie Batson Deputy Assistant Administrator for USAIDs Global Health Bureau Ive just returned from my first ever week in Pakistan and what a week it was Working with my colleagues in the US embassy and USAID offices and with their Pakistani counterparts I came to appreciate that development work in Pakistan is exceptionally hard but also very rewarding On Monday I visited to Peshawar a hour drive from Islamabad to meet with the health authorities and to visit a public health school for Lady Health Visitors Community Midwives and other paramedical staff You might know Peshawar from the news as one of the areas close to the Afghan border where lots of refugees have settled in camps to escape the violence in Afghanistan Although Ive worked in global health for 20 years this is the first time Ive ever needed an armored vehicle to visit a field site Once we arrived in Peshawar we changed cars picked up both US and armed Pakistani security escorts and continued driving ahead through the confused traffic of cars bicycles donkey carts and people After a journey through downtown Peshawar we finally arrived at our destination the school of public health that trains women to be deliver babies and health care in the most remote areas of Pakistan and I was given the all clear to open the car door the head scarf and long coat that I wore to show respect for local customs I cautiously went to meet the schools director She was already waiting on the front step with a big smile and bouquet of roses in her hand After introductions to her teaching staff of doctors and midwives she gave me a tour of the school First we visited two classrooms with 60 young women each of whom had been selected from over 600 applicants from around the country These women were in their 2nd year of the Lady Health Visitors program and would soon be accredited as midwives and medical personnel After they complete their training these women will return and work in health clinics that provide the only medical care that many in their community will ever clinics serve up to 10,000 people and the Lady Health Visitors provide services ranging from vaccinating infants and children to protecting them from diseases like measles whooping cough polio and hepatitis to providing care for pregnant women to delivering babies and educating families about the importance of nutrition and spacing of pregnancies The women were excited to meet someone from the US and to thank our country for supporting their school For only about 24 each month our US government supports a range of small upgrades to the school to help improve the learning environment and the quality of education provided These items included training materials models for anatomy class and structural upgrades to the classrooms and students hostels For the Community Midwives that were trained there basic equipment was provided for the girls to take to their health post once they graduated equipment like a birthing table safe delivery equipment sheets a sterilizer a stethoscope and small stipends for the women to live Director showed us the anatomy room with plastic models of the human body the delivery room and labor room a room with beds the immunization and consultation rooms and the dormitories The tour finished in the kitchen where the delicious smells of lunch which couldnt be eaten until we left came from an enormous pot sitting on a fire As we said our goodbyes in the courtyard we spotted an old Dodge school bus a gift from decades ago that was carefully cajoled into starting every now and then Im grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the work our government is doing to improve health around the world and for the opportunity to witness the impact assistance has in Pakistan Im confident that the lives and impact of the Pakistani health workers I met have been forever changed by our assistance In 20 years of development work Ive never had the armed escort but Ive also never been greeted with a bouquet of roses To read more go to http 

Late July Ambassador to Pakistan Anne Patterson issues a disaster declaration in response to extraordinarily heavy rainfall and flooding that begins in northern Pakistan in late July The flooding drifts south to Sindh province affecting an estimated 18 million people in every province More than 75 percent of affected families are located in Sindh and Punjab provinces and 1.7 million homes are destroyed Widespread flooding is reported in 82 of Pakistans 122 districts In coordination with the Pakistan government and other relief agencies USAID responds quickly to the devastation wrought by the floods USAIDs Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance OFDA immediately sends water treatment units and Zodiac boats to help rescue stranded people A Disaster Assistance Response Team DART soon arrives to assess conditions transport relief supplies and help meet the immediate needs of millions of people affected by the floods in Pakistan Photo AFP 

In an emergency more so than ever women tend to be worst affected This came swiftly into focus here in Pakistan when devastating monsoon rains at the end of July swept the country causing massive flooding from north to south Millions of people fled their homes to seek shelter in crowded temporary camps saving little more than the clothes on their backs Whilst such conditions would be hard for anyone they have been especially difficult for women Forced to cohabit in ways against the social norms and often unaware of their rights they have been left especially vulnerable An essential lifeline to aid one major challenge women have faced is a lack of identification cards In many families such cards are held only by the husband yet without an ID card women are unable to claim many of the benefits they are entitled to including government compensation This has become an especially important issue for households and those whose documents were washed away by the floods The simple fact alone that shalwar kameez womens traditional dress doesnt have any pockets meant that far more women than men lost their documentation when the floods hit

So far they have raised just 40 per flood victim according to an analysis by Oxfam While the earthquake killed far more people than the floods some 70,000 caring for its survivors was a less daunting task because there were fewer of them Kashmir is a much smaller and much less densely populated area than the wide swath of Pakistan inundated by the floods The total damage caused by the floods is twice that of the quake according to estimates by the World Bank

How Save the Children is helping Pakistan recover from the worst monsoon floods for more than 75 years The flooding in Pakistan affected 20 million people ten million of them children A year on many are still struggling to survive Millions of people are still living in temporary shelters with cramped living conditions poor sanitation and little access to clean water or nutritious food This report gives an look at life for children and their families coping with the aftermath of the flood 

Pakistan 2010 floods were the countrys worst in recorded history They killed more than 2,000 people and affected 18 million more than a tenth of the population A massive cascade of waters triggered by heavy monsoon rains in late July swept through the Indus River basin washing away homes roads bridges crops and livestock It ploughed a swathe of destruction from north to south and submerged of the country The flooding devastated parts of northwest province which saw some of the fiercest fighting in Pakistan war against Taliban insurgents People in the Swat Valley who had been trying to rebuild their lives following a massive military operation against the Taliban in 2009 were particularly badly affected The southern Punjab and Sindh provinces where the majority of Pakistanis live were also badly affected An estimated 11 million people were made homeless by the disaster The floods destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of cultivatable land and crops in the traditional regions of Sindh and Punjab and many farmers lost their seeds In some areas the water stagnated on the surface for months making planting difficult And at least 1.2 million livestock died crippling poor families who depended on them for food and draught power the Food and Agriculture Organisation said The price of vegetables and other foods rose making it harder for ordinary people to survive The country suffered more than 10 billion in damages to infrastructure irrigation systems bridges houses and roads SLOW AID The authorities and aid agencies struggled to help the survivors many of whom lost everything and said they received no warnings that raging waters were heading their way Many were forced to live in wretched conditions beside roads sleeping in the open with little food or clean water Fears of a second wave of deaths caused by and diseases such as cholera typhoid and malaria eased as the floodwaters receded Aid organisations and the government were criticised for being too slow to respond while the military the most powerful institution in Pakistan took the lead in relief operations With the government overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster charities linked to Islamist militants were quick to step in with help Pakistan promised to clamp down on these charities amid fears their involvement in flood relief would undermine the fight against groups like the Taliban The United Nations issued an appeal for 460 million in August Speaking at a special meeting on 19 Ban called the crisis one of the greatest tests of global solidarity in our times Major donors included the United States which gives billions of dollars in military aid to help Islamabad fight Taliban and al Qaeda fighters along the Afghan border Britain and the European Union However donors concerns about the countrys widespread corruption and lack of transparency slowed disbursal of funds 2011 FLOODS Pakistan was woefully unprepared for the 2011 monsoon season All along the Indus River dikes and embankments are incomplete while international donations for preparedness fell short Sindh is especially vulnerable to new flooding Although a repeat of the 2010 deluge is unlikely even smaller floods could cause millions of dollars in damages and set back reconstruction efforts experts said The head of the emergencies office OCHA in Pakistan Manuel Bessler warned in June 2011 that floods are likely to affect million people although that figure could rise to million if the monsoons are heavier than expected The United Nations said it has been working hard to stockpile food water and tents in case of more floods this year Pakistans monsoon season lasts until the first week of September 

The past few weeks have brought two tropical to the eastern seaboard of the United States They serve nicely to illustrate the topographic controls on flood generation that we were been talking about in my Fluvial Processes class recently Irene From 26-29 August Hurricane Irene cruised right along the east coast from North Carolinas Outer Banks to New York City As it continued northward its center moved inland running up through Vermont and into Canada The highest rainfall recorded during the storm was at Bayboro North Carolina where rainfall totals equaled 40 cm 15.74 That huge amount of rain caused some flooding in the flat and low Coastal Plain though media attention focused on multiple new inlets carved through the road linking Hatteras Island to the mainland Destruction from Irene near Randolph Vermont Note that debris hung up on the bridge railings indicating how high the waters were Also the bridge has been severed from the right bank by erosion outside the bridge abutment photo by Sarah Lewis and used with permission Farther north Irene caused disaster in the upstate New York and Vermont As rain from Irene dumped onto the steeper hillsides of the Catskills and Green Mountains small streams turned into torrents washing away roads bridges and buildings The flooding in Vermont is likely to be its worst disaster since another tropical storm flooded the state in 1927 But as the map below shows Irene dumped only 12 to 18 cm 5-7 inches of precipitation on Vermont which is less than half the amount that drenched North Carolina Precipitation totals from Hurricane Irene compiled by the National Weather Service Hydrometeorological Prediction Service There are couple of key differences between the two locations that explain why Vermont suffered more dramatic flooding than North Carolina First eastern North Carolina was in a pretty bad drought prior to Irene so there was plenty of unsaturated soil for the water to infiltrate into In contrast the first months of 2011 in Vermont were the 6th wettest on record with precipitation 131 of average Soils were already very wet and had little capacity to store or detain precipitation produced by Irene Second eastern North Carolina is FLAT while Vermont is rather more steep When the intense rains hit the land surface in Vermont gravity acted to pull the water downslope into streams and then down the streams much more efficiently than in North Carolina Given the same amount of rain over the same area and soils a steeper landscape is going to produce a larger flood than a flatter landscape Peak flows were higher in Vermont and the water had greater stream power to move sediment and wash away roads culverts and bridges Train tracks hang in where a culvert blew out from under them during flooding generated by Irene Photo near Randolph Vermont photo by Sarah Lewis and used with permission Lee Tropical storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana on September 4th and almost immediately weakened into a tropical depression and then a low But those classifications are based on wind speed and not water content In the last week as Lee has moved northward across the Gulf Coast states and then up and across the Appalachians it has dumped a huge volume of water across at least 10 states In this storm the precipitation center on Louisiana and Mississippi where Lee first made landfall and the Susquehanna River watershed in New York and Pennsylvania In those areas precipitation totals exceeded 38 cm 15 in NASA satellite TRMM data showing rainfall totals for 31 August to September via Dave Petley of the The Landslide Blog Lee did generate flooding in Mississippi and Louisiana and caused four deaths On the Pearl River at Jackson Mississippi where the USGS reported more than inches of precipitation on 4-5 September the flooding was above flood stage but only on the order of floods seen on average once every years Along the Susquehanna River over 100,000 people were ordered to evacuate neighborhoods in cities like Binghampton NY PA Harrisburg PA and Havre de Grace MD as the river was predicted to crest at the level of houses in some neighborhoods While the flooding appears to have been less bad than predicted in some places the Susquehanna at set a new record 6.3 m 20.6 ft above flood stage The previous record had been set by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 Wet soils from the rainfall dumped by Irene probably exacerbated the flooding in Pennsylvania While both the Gulf Coast and Susquehanna River watershed experienced flooding from Lee a quick comparison of the peak discharge per unit area reveals how much more impressive the flooding on the Susquehanna is from a hydrologic perspective The Pearl River at Jackson MS crested at 929 cubic meters per second from a drainage area of 8213 square kilometers The Susquehanna River at PA crested above 9799 cubic meters per second and the discharge estimates at the very highest water levels havent been reported yet At the Susquehanna has a drainage area of 25,796 square kilometers Dividing peak discharge by watershed area we get a peak unit discharge for the Pearl River of 0.11 On the Susquehanna the value is more than times higher 0.38 General Principle In a paper using USGS annual peak streamflow records to look at the geography of big floods in the United States OConnor and Costa 2004 describe the phenomenon of tropical storms topography being the vital constituents of really big floods in the eastern US They wrote The importance of orographic effects and topographic concentration of streamflow for generating high unit discharges along the Atlantic coast is illustrated by the rarity of high unit discharges in Florida and along the Coastal Plain of the southern and eastern tier States Despite being closest to the moisture sources and subject to frequent landings of major hurricanes and intense rainfall Konrad 2001 these comparatively flat and permeable areas do not produce large unit discharges Watersheds with the top of annual peakflows in 100 years of USGS stream gaging records Figure 4a from and Costa 2004 Spatial distribution of the largest floods from basins between 2.6 and 26,000 km in the United States and Puerto Rico Water Resources Research 40 paper not subject to copyright While none of the flooding generated by Irene and Lee may break into the ranks of the top of floods shown on the figure above they conform to the expectation that bigger peak flows occur where there is steep topography rather than where the land is flat They are also a sobering reminder that the news story is far from over when a tropical storm moves inland from the beach Inland flooding like we have been witnessing is responsible for more than half of the fatalities from tropical storms in the US Id be a bit morbidly curious to see a map of those fatalities and see whether they occur along the coasts or up in the hills Whatever the statistics this hurricane season has been an impressive reminder that those of us far from the beach need to pay attention to tropical storm forecasts and be prepared for intense rain and flooding cyclone is the general term for tropical storms and hurricanes In other oceans hurricanes are also called typhoons and cyclones Tropical cyclone encompasses them all 

Tis the season when professors write their syllabi and lead their first classes when students decide whether to take that elective in geophysics or the one in hydrogeology and when professional and armchair geologistswell I dont know what they do because Ive been a student or professor for as long as I can remember In any case it is a time of year that provokes anticipatory excitement feelings of nostalgia and wishes for wisdom In this spirit Im calling for posts on theme of back to school for the next Accretionary Wedge But this carnival isnt really about curriculum and textbooks and there wont be a final exam Instead Im thinking about the things that we dont often learn or teach in school but that may turn out to be quite important in the real world Im envisioning a carnival in which we all get a chance to give and get advice and share stories about geosciences education and careers Im hoping that this collection of posts can be a resource for people falling in love with rocks or water or maps and trying to figure out how to turn that infatuation into a career Im going to list below a series of the head questions that I think fit the theme Im envisioning but feel free to add or interpret as you see fit Please submit your posts by the time you go to bed on Friday 30 September and Ill compile and post the carnival in the first week of October

Its now been two weeks since Christchurch got its last big shake Since then New Zealand seismometers have registered around 200 further shocks of magnitude or greater Most of these occurred in the first or days following the magnitude on the 12th June activity is dying away in the expected roughly manner Frequency of aftershocks following the 12th June earthquake in Christchurch Data from Geonet If we plot the latest pulse of aftershocks on a map data courtesy of Geonet they plot mainly on the Banks Peninsula to the southeast of Christchurch Locations of earthquakes around Christchurch between 12 and 24 June Data from Geonet Most of the faults in this area are probably fractures around the main vent If so the peninsula may be acting as a sort of seismic sponge with the strain pushed into the area by the ruptures near Christchurch being absorbed by aftershocks on lots of small fault segments rather than there being a large thoroughgoing structure that could release all the strain in one go It certainly seems that after a reasonably active week following the June 12 quake seismic activity on the Banks peninsula seems to have faded away almost completely Location of quakes around Christchurch quakes between 19 and 24 June Note the relative lack of activity on the Banks Peninsula compared to 12-19 June Data from Geonet I should just add here that there is no risk of this triggering an eruption of the very very extinct volcanoes that form the Banks Peninsula There is no magma chamber beneath these volcanoes any more and hasnt been for millions of years so there is nothing for all of this seismic activity to disturb or trigger or awaken A more pertinent question for the residents of Christchurch is are we going to get hit by another magnitude 6+ in the next few months There is sadly no way of knowing for sure The seismic activity on and around the Darfield and Port Hills faults since last September has probably dissipated much of the tectonic strain built up on them in the thousands of years since they last ruptured But there is a fair amount of uncertainty about this because we dont know the past history of these faults we dont know how long its been exactly since they last ruptured or how much strain has built up on them since then Nonetheless probably the biggest worry going forward is not the faults we know about but the faults we might not know about hidden beneath the Canterbury plains Dr Mark Quigley the University of Canterbury geologist who has made a habit of popping up on New Zealand TV after the latest earthquake to provide clear explanations of whats going on discussed in his latest appearance and on his website a potentially analogous situation from a region near the San Andreas Fault in California where a large earthquake the magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake and associated magnitude 6+ events in 1992 were followed seven years later by a large earthquake on a nearby parallel fault segment the magnitude 7.1 Hectors Mine Earthquake As the maps below show these earthquakes were on parallel faults subsidiary to the main branch of the San Andreas Fault about 20 km 15 miles apart the red lines in the top map mark historically active faults courtesy of the USGS The relative locations of the 1992 Joshua Bear earthquakes and the 1992 Hectors Mine Earthquake Top map created using USGS Quaternary Faults Database bottom map from Parsons Drager 2000 The link between these two earthquakes is discussed in this paper published in 2000 by Tom Parsons of the USGS and Douglas Dreger of UC Berkeley Their calculations of permanent stress changes following the Landers earthquake indicate that this is a case of earthquake triggering deformation of the crust around the Landers rupture slightly increased the stress on parts of the neighbouring fault that ruptured in the Hectors Mine earthquake years later and the sections of the fault where the stress was increased the most were also the sections that slipped the most in 1999 So could a similar situation be possible near Christchurch The tectonic situations are certainly broadly similar we have subsidiary faults to a major plate boundary the Alpine Fault But what we dont know is if the Darfield and Port Hills faults have tectonic other faults with long seismic cycles of thousands of years that are close enough to potentially be influenced by the recent seismicity The answer to this question is hidden beneath the thick recent sediments of the Canterbury Plain which extend more than 30 kilometres north and south of Christchurch Known active faults in the Christchurch region based on historical seismicity and geological evidence for recent motion Source GNS We know that there are some basement faults in this region but with new seismic and gravity surveys New Zealand geologists hope to more firmly identify the faults that have disrupted overlying sediments in the past 10-20,000 years and are therefore active and those that have not so are inactive Once active structures have been identified we can calculate whether the regional stress changes caused by the recent earthquakes have increased or decreased the risk of a rupture in the near future The continuing seismicity might also provide some clues an interesting observation from the Parsons and Drager paper was that in the years between 1992 and 1999 there were a number of small earthquakes clustered around the eventual Hectors Mine rupture Such activity is not predictive of larger earthquakes but small quake clusters may help to identify weak points in the crust worthy of further investigation So there is still a fair amount of uncertainty to be honest even with all the data currently being collected we will never have complete knowledge of the seismic risks facing Christchurch in the decades ahead But the more we know the better informed the people of Christchurch will be as they make choices over how and where to rebuild Parsons Dreger 2000 impact of the 1992

Naimat Ahmeds village in Thatta district in Sindh is still under water She shows me her flooded field where shed been growing rice wading into the waters to show me how high the levels still remain She opens up the door to her simple home which is full of squelchy mud She wont be able to move back inside until the ground dries out and has to sleep with others in the village out in the open air in makeshift shelters constructed from wooden poles with cotton sheeting as a roof Yet she and a group of other women in the village were determined to head back home as quickly as possible after Pakistans devastating floods to protect their stake to the land is here We feared if we didnt come back quickly people would come and stay here and take things from our homes Naimat Ahmed told grants bring social changeNaimats wish to protect her precious assets is understandable Until earlier this year she had no land at all until she was awarded four acres under the Sindh provincial governments land program Its the first program of its kind in South Asia where tracts of land are given to landless women peasants in an attempt to begin reducing poverty and bring about much wider social changes in rural estimated 60 of people in Sindh are landless while large areas of farmland are owned by small wealthy and politically influential elites And now Pakistans devastating floods which destroyed homes fields and livestock are forcing some of the poorest in Pakistan without adequate food shelter or jobs deeper into the floods cameThis was going to be my first crop from my own land and the rice was almost ready to harvest Then the floods came said Naimat Everything was destroyed I cant see how we can get enough food and it will be several months before we can use our land again But even then we dont have money for seeds and fertilizer she said We have debts from shops that have given us credit Things are was the region by the floods and in many areas flood waters still remain stubbornly high refusing to drain away More than a million people remain displaced their homes damaged or destroyed The worry is that when families do return home new disputes could arise over land as many boundaries previously marked by irrigation channels have been washed away and ownership records have been destroyed land was a blessing Land disputes had arisen even before the floods The first phase of Sindhs land redistribution program had some serious flaws and was tainted by allegations of nepotism and of six Aasi Mallah was physically attacked by people in her village in Jati town who disputed her claim to land after she had been awarded a four acre plot by the provincial government Our land was a blessing But a large group of people gathered and threatened us they became violent and beat us she told me showing me a scar on her daughters and her family were forced to flee their village and now live on a small plot of land by a roadside owned by her husbands former landlord determined to pursue her land battle through the courts It could be a long process Oxfam and its partner Participatory Development Initiatives have been helping Aasi and other women like her with legal support as well as spreading awareness among some of the poorest in Sindh about their rights to claim for land under the the cycle of debt and poverty Some of the original flaws in the land program have been ironed out thanks to lobbying by groups like PDI and Oxfam And despite the floods the authorities in Sindh have pledged to continue with the scheme rolling it out to more areas across the rights for women in Pakistan is a rarity and sometimes an impossibility said Saima Hassan PDIs Land for Women Programme officer The distribution of government land to landless peasant women in Sindh is a historic initiative And while it has had flaws were trying to make sure that all the women eligible for land under the scheme receive it and can change their status from peasant to hope is that not only will the program continue to be rolled out across Sindh but also in other parts of Pakistan giving some of the poorest families a chance to own land that for generations theyve cultivated and lived on a chance to finally begin to lift themselves out of the cycle of poverty and moreVideo After three months large areas of Pakistan are still under floodwaterPakistan floods Oxfam humanitarian response

Even in this hour of destruction in Pakistan we the one watching these pics are foolish and judgmental to make statements criticizing politicians and talking about religion failed states I am feeling really sad and appalled to see people simple and innocent are the ones suffering the most the floods are a question of life and death to the people who are going through it people who only want to live a day at a time survivors must be thinking will they get food the next day And here we are criticizing states and politics taking side of religion I am an Indian and a Hindu by religion and I do see why only Allah should save Pakistan why does it not come to us naturally to pray that ALL GODs should help ALL people around the globe who are suffering similarly whether it be in Russia US Iraq Pakistan India and so forth Why have we given the reins of our lives in the hands of few people read politicians who have no motive but to amass wealth by looting everybody irrespective of their religion or nationality And finally why pray at all why not learn now that this has already happened let us people the ones who can think beyond religion politics and nationalities think and take steps to see that such natural calamities do minimum harm when they strike next time Let us give GOD some break let Him take some rest Let us not just ask and keep asking for his help but work with Him to bring more love and compassion around us beyond politics and nationalities GOD help us help them Posted by Soman August 10 05:53 PM 

Climate scientists have predicted that along with gradually rising average temperatures we would experience more severe weather events Like the drought in Russia and the flooding in Pakistan Yet as long as it gets cold somewhere anywhere at least once a year the deniers will continue to deny that global climate change is real And unfortunately the deniers have enough influence over our US policy to prevent us from doing anything to address the issue We must vote politicians out of office who deny the reality of global climate change Posted by Sceptic August 10 09:30 AM 

Basically this kind of flooding is happening for the past 10 years in South Asia Every monsoon is bringing with it a devastating flood to a different region We need to manage floods better by Having good flood warning systems and identifying areas which were previously flooded and also the level which the flood waters reached and then changing how we build housing and flood shelters in these areas I Want Indias to take notice of this since is when we have our floods We have to prepare adequately We I am Posted by Vishnu Sharma August 10 07:19 PM 

its sad to see that people still have the nerve to say that Pakistan is not worth their dollars or aid the point is here is not that Pakistan is going through a hard time the point here is that innocent people are being effectd by it they are loosing their families their homes their every little thing they have spent their whole lives gathering We are not asking for your charity instead we are asking for support that any individual would give to another who is wounded Would you not help an individual who is hurt on the street or would u keep walking your own thinking he has caused this on himself if you so you need to look at yourself properly in the mirror and ask yourself how would you feel if you were left alone dying without any food any water and not even knowing where your family is Posted by amajid August 10 09:00 PM

It just breaks your heart to see what is happening in Pakistan I am afraid that there is no present or future planning to reverse this calamity to their advantage A few months from now Pakistani people will be complaining that there is no water to produce electricity for crops or for other purposes For starters why cant they have hundreds of man made lakes outside every village so that they are able to water their crops and have drinking water for animals and themselves 500 X 500 feet by twenty feet deep man made lakes outside every village could help in the future instead of let all the flood water go to the Indian Ocean The lakes could be dug by villagers to help them selves They have to stop looking towards their leaders for decision making and give hand outs People keep on waiting for leaders to plan and decide their present and future or blame the West for every thing Population increase could be four times in twenty years Try to supply food water electricity shelter and other necessities for 84 crore people God never promised food and shelter for every human being Ask the street beggars outside the mosques and the people of Africa who are starving God will not help those who can not help them self Pakistanis wanted water They got that Now what God keeps asking in the Quran Why cant they think It is too late to dig out any lakes now There is lack of master plan at the local or provincial or federal levels Heartbreaking and huge devastation from earthquake and floods may not stop in future as well Do Pakistanis have any city or federal codes developed or copied from the West for most of the infrastructure to withstand 7.5 Richter scale earthquakes to combat with in future After floods when so many homes are destroyed can they build homes and other buildings to a city or a Federal code so that they are in rows and streets with proper drainage for future floods with water accumulating somewhere for future use Did they ask US or other allies in the war of terror to help them in future planning with the use of the US city and Federal codes that they have in place for the US towns There is no lessons learned from the problems they have faced in the is the lack of population control and lack of education for the population control that bothers me They have an abundance of sunshine they can buy or build solar panels and use them for electric generation the individual homes It is just too much to mention and the Pakistanis keep looking for hand outs from leaders who put 95 in their own pocket and make lofty is lack of leadership and sense of direction at the grass root level Keep praying for God help If Pakistanis do not help themselves the results should not surprise any one 

Allah the merciful has been kind on land of the pure We were starving and loosing crops due to no water and treachery of Hindus stealing it We wanted more water and he gave us This proves Allah exists we are right and Al Bakistan is the truly a blessed land We need to clear it of few This is also is an opportunity for us to get America to give us and Apache helicopters for flood relief We also need 500 155mm Light howitzers plus Drones with hellfire mizziles Amen 

You know what really bothers me as a human and as an American That we think mercy should be given only to the deserving Who are we to decide who is deserving And mercy is for those who have committed a sin and need forgiveness or those who are hurting and need help My fiance lives in Pakistan That God that his family lives just far enough away from the floods that they only sustained minor water damage For those who are laughing or being cruel about the man with the chicken around his neck Let me educate you These people are starving They have been for several generations A chicken is valuable because it lays eggs and becomes meat in a place where food is hard to come by They have just lost their crops their land is saturated and the water is poison because of the death and decay in it They have no toilets because there is no housing Bless God that my sweet Fiance lives in Islamabad and is ok But the death toll with rise and the sickness and smell become unbearable Their government is like a drunk Overindulging in the money of others drinking it up at the expense of the giver and those who should have received it in the first place We should not be giving them money Not to the government If you really want to help contact Islamic relief in the UK They are working face to face hand in hand with the people themselves You can find their website and undated videos on YouTube Please stop giving us spoiled Americans such a bad name and reputation by being selfish and cruel Remember hurricane Katrina and how much suffering happened That was nothing compared to this but we were hurting just the same You worry about their religion They may be so much closer to our Lord than you because you do not show the compassion of Christ for the hurting and forgiveness to innocent people These citizens did not send terrorists to our country They do even have the resources to fight the same aggressors face to face every day and deal with watching their own loved ones suffer and die at the hands of their own radical countrymen Have some love and respect and mercy If I had the resources I would be there right now helping feed clothe and bathe anyone who needed it Dry clothes and a bath and toilet mean alot when you have 1500 people and toilets When you feed the poor clothe the naked give a cup of water to a child it is as if you did this for Christ He said so Himself You will be rightly judged one day so please if you ca help and you have to speak out loud say words that will be gracious and say them in prayer Posted by Brenda Booker August 12 10 05:52 PM 

Apart from blaming our deeds aamals and leaving everything to Allah we should blame on the poor planning or no planning at all by our current and previous governments to deal with such catastrophes As 1/5th of Pakistan is under water at this moment were we prepared if only 1/100th of Pakistan was affected The answer is no and the evidence is clear from the poor performance of Pakistans National Disasters Management Authority NDMA The NDMAs web site shows no signs of such preparedness I see a big lack of leaderships effort in bringing the attention of Pakistanis to this disaster They do not have guts to come to TV and address the nation saying My countrymen wake up we need your help Bring the attention of industrialist to donate artists to raise money doctors to treat patients engineers to rebuild and students to help helpless Provide an honest assessment and plan to deal with the situation to earn public confidence back so people start donating wholeheartedly We do not need to go overseas and beg We still have enough intelligence if used positively and resources to recover and come out better than ever I see an utmost need of mapping the country for identifying low lying areas prohibiting human habitat in those areas or protecting them by levees around water bodies so we can save human lives and infrastructure in future Build emergency centers food and emergency supply storages and shelters at strategic locations to deal with future catastrophes NDMA must train ordinary people on regular basis to have them ready for dealing with disasters I also see a serious need of watershed planning and management including building new dams setting aside all political differences If we had few additional dams at present we would have been relatively less vulnerable Dissolving local bodies was another blunder that present government made in its policies If a Nazim could gather 5000 people to attend a political rally he must be ashamed not to give a call to his supporters in his district to help flood stranded poor people God help Pakistan and descend a sensible leadership 

I am a Proud pakistani in USA I am taking a flight tomorrow back to Pakistan and will inshaAllah help the flood affectees For my friends around the world who are looking for a reliable source to give their money for the affectees my suggestion is to give it either to RED CROSS RED CRESCENT or EDHI charity Organisation which is the biggest and most reliable pakistan based NGO I want to respond to specially some indians who posted comments before me u guys are always eager to FISH IN TROUBLED WATERS and making fun of these calamity struck people Should i mention the hundreds of millions of people in your country living under similar conditions EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO NATURAL CALAMITY plz take care of these SLUMDOGs before u say something about others Grow up and come out of ur inferiority complex Posted by Taimoor Khan August 17 10 08:14 AM 

it so sad to see that people are dying in Pakistan YET instead of helping them people are discussing Politics Let the people suffers just because they live across the boundaries May ALLAH SWT give us heart to feel another human pain and help them in these severe conditions Posted by khadija August 17 10 01:32 PM 

I think its not time to criticize any one on the basis of religion politics and racism Today they are victim tomorrow might be you So please think about the survival of humans in this earth else every thing will be finished soon We should also focus ourselves towards proper planning to tackle such natural disaster to overcome the loss as minimum as we can If there was kala bagh dam then probably there would be not even single water of flood in the Pakistan So thumbs up remove all the hard feelings from your hearts join hands and save the humanity Posted by Adeel Fakhar August 18 10 06:51 AM

ADDITIONAL REPORTS AND DISCUSSION Add Sultan Rome Advocate Shangla Oct 2010 Shangla a valley of sorrows is in grip of natural disasters Earthquake Floods Rains and terrorism The spell of heavy rains and floods beginning in the month of July 2010 affected approximately million people in Pakistan It caused death of thousands of people and many more were injured across the country Hundreds of dwelling houses shops roads bridges and other infrastructures were completely washed away by floods This is the biggest natural disaster of history in Pakistan Shangla is an unfortunate valley which also severely affected in recent natural disaster In fact natural resources and beauty is bestowed by God to Shangla valley Due to its scenic beauty ever greenery and fragrant air it is piece of paradise on earth Shangla upgraded to status of district on July 10 1995 by the then chief minister Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao On one hand Shangla valley is gifted with natural beauty while on the other hand Shangla is a backward and tribal society where majority of the people live below the poverty line and are illiterate Its poverty and backwardness can be well estimated from the fact that Shangla district is on top in ratio of poverty in Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa province and on 2nd across the Pakistan Due to negligence of government and its elected representatives Shangla lag behind in the run of development Similarly the natural disasters and calamities had made this valley miserable Since long Shangla is confronted with natural disasters and terrorist activities Shangla has been affected in 1974 by destructive earthquake and in 2004 by the severe snowfall mud sliding and fall of avalanches In October 2005 a powerful and devastating earthquake struck the Shangla caused major destruction and take of lives of thousands peoples The affects of which still existed in the of the people They have not reconstructed their damaged houses yet Similarly the valley remained in grip of terrorist activities since 2007 Fear and fright prevailed among the people due to terrorism Activities and businesses of the people remained suspended due to continuous curfew Thousands of people had to leave their homes and compelled to leave as IDPs The current natural disaster and spell of torrential rains and floods hit this valley severely once again Shangla which was already deprived of basic needs and rights of life the current devastating damages pushed it back almost a 100 years Keeping in view all these calamities Shangla may be named a valley of sorrows In Shangla 168 people lost their lives and hundreds of people suffered from injuries as a result of such natural disaster The torrential rains and flash floods destroyed about 110 communication bridges including main bridges and suspension 500 KM roads including 150 KM main roads and 350 KM link roads 139 hydro power stations including major stations 450 water mills 3233 dwelling houses completely 4514 dwelling houses partially Health units Similarly 51 schools including 27 boys primary schools 21 girls primary schools middle schools girls middle school high schools and 278 water supply schemes have been damaged The floodwater and rain also damaged standing crops on 9603 acre area 1200 acre agricultural land 25 pedestrian streets 89 water sources 25 water tanks oil pump shops vehicles standing trees and timbers The floods also washed away buffalos 934 cows 613 and 840 animal shelters In short the floods completely washed away all resources of income of people of Shangla The severely affected union councils in Shangla are Pirkhana Damori Shahpur Koozkana Ranial Opal Dheri Pirabad and Butial In Shangla major unpleasant incident occurred in village Olandar of Pirkhana Kana where at least 60 people have been died in land sliding The damages of the current floods and rains are much more severe as compared to earthquake of 2005 In 2005 at least it was possible to find the dead body of the person died due to earthquake while the dead bodies have been washed away by the recent floods In earthquake of 2005 houses were destroyed but the goods of the houses were present in the remains The earthquake affected people had a place to sit on the remains or on the surroundings while the floods have completely drained houses its all goods and even its In current disaster if anyone has succeeded to save his life that is only in his dressing He has ran away bare headed and bare footed After 2005 earthquake affected people were able to raise tents in fields surroundings of their destroyed houses but now no field or area is left behind to fix tent to live in Majority of affected people are laying deprived and helpless only on the mercy of God In earthquake of 2005 the roads and bridges were safe while in recent turmoil neither road nor bridge remained safe The peoples are confronted with trouble to get their livelihoods In earthquake of 2005 there was no damage to electric and telecommunication systems while after current flash floods all these things do not exist Mostly maize crop is produced in Shangla and if anyone has maize in their homes but no water mill is existed to tread the maize On one hand this natural disaster has damaged the peoples lives health and wealth on the other hand it has also damaged them mentally The educational institutes affected first by terrorism in the region and now the current natural disaster have once again severely affected the academic activities The children are really confronted with critical situation and need special measurements As Shangla was already in grip of natural disasters such as earthquake of 1974 and 2005 suicide attacks militancy military operations curfews and displacement the current floods proved another severe blow The people of Shangla need special attention of government and nongovernmental organisations In this regard media can play a key role to highlight these problems of people of Shangla

Reconstruction challenges Khmer Rouge trials It has taken years of negotiations to establish a tribunal to try former leaders of the Khmer Rouge a delay that has blighted Cambodia international reputation The courtroom and administrative offices of the Special Tribunal finally opened in a military complex just outside Phnom Penh in early 2006 27 years after the regime was driven from power Cambodian and international judges agreed in June 2007 on the underlying rules for the special court to try Pol Pot top surviving henchmen A month later the first formal charges of crimes against humanity were laid against Kaing Guek Eav nicknamed Duch former commander of the notorious Tuol Sleng interrogation and torture centre His trial began in February 2009 In September authorities arrested and charged Khmer Rouge Brother Number Two Nuon Chea Pol Pot top surviving henchman The octogenarian had been living as a free man since cutting a deal with Phnom Penh in 1998 Having confessed to mass murder Duch is expected to be a key witness against Nuon Chea Also under arrest are Khieu Samphan former foreign minister Ieng Sary and his wife Khieu Thirith Military chief Ta Mok died in 2006 Most Cambodians saw his death as an escape from justice reviving fears that senior Khmer Rouge members would die before facing the tribunal The court has been plagued by delays and arguments between local and international legal officials Critics say that the process will not meet international standards given its unusual mixed structure that will include local judges and prosecutors often criticised as corrupt weak and lacking in independence The United Nations had initially wanted a panel of exclusively international judges sitting outside Cambodia to run the tribunal The Cambodian government originally demanded Cambodian judges only But a compromise was reached in 2001 on the hybrid formula which stipulates three Cambodian and two foreign judges In 2008 the court asked donors for an additional 114 million on top of its initial 56 million budget Poverty and aid International donor governments and institutions agreed in 2007 to give Cambodia 690 million in grants and loans up from 601 million 2006 and 504 million in 2005 The Cambodian government which relies on foreign aid to cover as much as 60 percent of its spending described the huge increase as a reward for the country good performance in reforming its economy The World Bank says the number of Cambodians living under the poverty line has dropped but that the benefits of growth have been spread unevenly resulting in a rise in inequality Economic growth has been largely limited to urban centres and the income gap between rich and poor remains a serious problem Donors have called for greater commitment to reform of a notoriously corrupt and political judiciary and swift enactment of draft laws that have been gathering dust on the shelves of parliament for years Activists say that donor calls for political reform carry little weight given the continuing disbursement of vast sums of aid money which they say sends completely the wrong signal to a government that continues to harass and intimidate human rights defenders opposition party members and journalists Campaigners also say that huge amounts of aid are wasted on Technical Assistance TA namely expensive foreign consultants who are drafted in to advise recipient governments There has been no systematic analysis of the effectiveness of TA in Cambodia the advocacy group ActionAid said in a 2005 report According to the report some 1.2 billion was spent on TA between 1999 and 2003 In 2002 the aid spent by donors on some 700 consultants amounted to between 50 and 70 million roughly equivalent to the wage bill of 160,000 Cambodian civil servants who earn as little as 25 a month Donors have promised aid worth 951.5 million for 2009 the most since 1994 even though some have expressed concern over the government plan to double spending on the military next year to 500 million after a border clash with Thailand in 2008 Landmines Landmines continue to represent one of the most destructive legacies of Cambodia violent past Estimates vary but it is believed that there are between four and six million landmines in Cambodian soil According to the United Nation Electronic Mine Information Network close to half of all villages are affected with a suspected contaminated area of almost 4,500 square kilometres Today of the victims are children in the countryside This brings the number of mine injured or Cambodia to more than 60,000 Amnesty International says many of the victims are poor people seeking land who have moved into affordable areas yet to be Numerous factors render Cambodia particularly vulnerable to Decades of conflict combined with chronic poverty and political turmoil have led to a weak health infrastructure that struggles to care for all those living with the disease According to UNAIDS diseases have already killed more than 80,000 primarily from heterosexual sex and the government expects the death toll to reach 230,000 by 2010 There are also more than 50,000 AIDS orphans Yet having suffered one of the highest infection rates in Asia the country has begun to see some success in its fight against the epidemic After peaking at percent in 1997 national adult HIV prevalence in Cambodia fell to 1.6 percent in 2005 according to the 2006 AIDS epidemic update At the heart of the success was the government decision to order all brothels which are legal in Cambodia to require sex workers to insist on the use of condoms But UNAIDS warned in 2007 that men were increasingly turning to indirect sex workers women who informally sell sex outside brothels with whom they are less likely to use a condom Officials warn that still has the potential to impede significantly the social and economic development of the country Bird Flu The first case of bird flu in Cambodia was confirmed by the government in January 2004 As of early 2009 seven Cambodians had died of the virus See our bird flu briefing for more

More than 374,000 people were injured and millions left homeless when the 8.0 magnitude quake struck southwestern Sichuan province Its epicentre was in the mountainous county of Wenchuan where nearly 24,000 died or are counted as missing about a fifth of the population Thousands of aftershocks heavy rainfall and landslides compounded the difficulties for military government and private workers trying to deliver shelter and aid The earthquake was by far the worst since the devastating 1976 quake in the northeastern city of Tangshan that killed up to 300,000 people The Geological Survey said the Sichuan quake struck at 0628 GMT at a depth of 10 km miles The aftershocks killed more people and brought down further buildings In the regions the hilly rural area of Beichuan and Wenchuan to the southwest buckled and blocked roads made it difficult for rescuers and supplies to get through China mobilised 130,000 army and paramilitary troops to the area some of them hiking in on foot Buildings toppled in at least six counties near the epicentre according to the Chinese news service Xinhua Although most of the focus has been on Sichuan the quake also affected Gansu and Shaanxi provinces striking areas that are predominantly poor CLAMPDOWN ON PARENT PROTESTS Public anger has focused on the poor state of school buildings with many blaming lax building controls and corruption for shoddy construction China says 5,335 schoolchildren were killed while other estimates have put the figure at between 7,000 and 9,000 Grieving parents have likened the school buildings to soft tofu dregs They accuse officials or builders of cutting corners and pocketing money meant to be used to construct stronger classrooms The government ordered a nationwide safety inspection of all public buildings after the disaster It also launched an inquiry into why so many schools crumbled This concluded they collapsed because of the size of the quake rather than construction flaws Beijing fears that the anger of bereaved parents could trigger unrest especially around the anniversary It clamped down on media coverage in the aftermath of the quake and has arrested activists trying to seek justice Parents demanding inquiries have been detained in black jails informal detention rooms in hotels and offices according to Amnesty International Chinese lawyers and human rights activists who have offered help to grieving families have also been intimidated and detained and their efforts to bring cases to court have been stymied Amnesty says in a report A month before the anniversary China said it would spend an extra billion yuan 1.17 billion on making schools in areas safer RELIEF EFFORT China launched a massive aid operation immediately after the quake sending in troops to rescue people trapped in rubble organise evacuations and deliver aid Scores of aircraft were also deployed The quake marked the first time that China had asked for outside assistance to deal with a major disaster But agencies and international groups played a relatively minor role partly because China has significant resources and long experience in dealing with large crises Western commentators have praised China for its swift reaction and openness contrasting it with Myanmar secretive response to Cyclone Nargis which had struck just over a week earlier Myanmar blocked foreign aid for several weeks One of the most immediate needs in the quake zone was shelter Hundreds of thousands of tents and temporary housing units simple steel structures normally used by construction workers were brought into the area China ambitious aim is to get everyone back into permanent housing within a year or two But the destruction was vast officials have said 4.8 million people lost their homes Francis Markus the China spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said his organisation likened the magnitude of the task to rebuilding Los Angeles or Osaka Survivors are desperate not to spend another cold winter in temporary dwellings And in the wait for relief some have made angry claims about corruption favouritism or delays The government has promised trillion yuan 147 billion for rebuilding although Jiang Jufeng governor of Sichuan province has said 1.7 trillion yuan is needed for the task The government is offering building subsidies of between 16,000 and 26,000 yuan for homes and loans of 50,000 yuan that are first and then But building a house costs between 70,000 and 100,000 yuan or more Markus said that one year on there were still lots of people who could not start rebuilding their homes including those unable to get bank loans because they are too old to qualify or too poor or do have a stable source income The town of Beichuan which is surrounded by mountains was so badly devastated that it will be rebuilt on an absolutely flat river plain to the south The plan is to turn the old town into a memorial site QUAKE LAKES The Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO has said the quake caused damage worth billion to the region agriculture More than 30 million people in rural communities lost most of their assets thousands of hectares of farmland were destroyed and millions of farm animals died the FAO says The agency which says China has asked it to coordinate agricultural rehabilitation in Sichuan predicts it will take three to five years to rebuild the sector The World Health Organisation says up to 10 percent of those affected by the earthquake will need mental health care The agency is consulting with the Chinese government on rebuilding hospitals to withstand future natural disasters Immediately after the quake officials were also worried about possible damage to dams and the numbers of rivers that were blocked by landslides forming more than 30 quake lakes Premier Wen Jiabao warned of the risk of secondary disasters caused by heavy rains and ordered experts to inspect dams and reservoirs on regular patrols Authorities evacuated about 250,000 people living downstream of the largest such lake Tangjiashan In June 2008 floodwaters from the lake were released and swamped areas in Beichuan China was also put on precautionary alert against possible radiation leaks The disaster area is home to China chief nuclear weapons research lab in Mianyang as well as several secretive atomic sites but no nuclear power stations

A humanitarian crisis Government troops and rebel militias regularly kill and rape civilian men women and children and thousands of families are on the run for their lives Some 5.4 million people died between August 1998 and April 2007 from violence and hunger and illness according to studies by aid agency International Rescue Committee IRC which says fighting frequently prevents people from seeking out what scant health services are available It is the deadliest conflict since World War Two IRC calculated in 2007 that as many as 45,000 people are dying every month More than 476,000 Congolese refugees are scattered across the region although some have returned home says the refugee agency UNHCR About 1.7 million peoplewere displaced within the country borders in July 2011 the vast majority in North Kivu and South Kivu provinces the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre said One million internally displaced people are estimated to have returned home between and the end of 2010 The figures fluctuate rapidly as waves of violence means large numbers of people are regularly uprooted from homes for short periods of time The majority first seek refuge in the forest close to their fields and property But there they are often vulnerable to attack and hunger and lack of shelter force them to seek help elsewhere Most people end up living with host families who themselves struggle to make ends meet After a while they are forced to move again when their hosts can no longer cope Human Rights Watchsays Unable to access fields to grow crops many end up dependent on food aid But aid agencies often can not reach the displaced because they are sheltering in areas which are very remote or surrounded by insecurity Aid experts regularly cite the crisis in Congo as the most underreported emergency in the world RAPE The actual number of women and girls raped in eastern Congo is unknown but experts and campaigners say the scale is enormous The United Nations special representative on sexual violence in conflict Margot Wallstrom has called Congo the rape capital of the world Forty women are raped every day according to the Congolese Women Campaign Against Sexual Violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo The number of reported rapes has dropped in recent years The United Nations said 26,000 women were raped in South Kivu alone in 2006 but the figure dropped to about 5,000 in 2009 In 2010 the figure fell to about 160 a month in North and South Kivu according to the United Nations In 2010 a coalition of militiamen raped more than 387 people in four days in the town of Luvungi in North Kivu a report said peacekeepers were criticized for failing to prevent the attacks which took place just 20 miles 32 km from a base It is not just the sheer numbers but also the form the rape takes To see so many raped that shocks me but what shocks me more is the way they are raped said Denis Mukwege an Congolese doctor who established Panzi Hospital of Bukavu in South Kivu which treats women for their injuries Militia groups and soldiers target all ages including girls as young as three and elderly women They are gang raped raped with bayonets and have guns shot into their vaginas destroying their reproductive and digestive systems Men and boys have also been raped The rape epidemic began in the according to Wilhelmine Ntakebuka who coordinates a sexual violence programme in Bukavu This is when Rwandan Hutu militiamen escaped to Congo after taking part in Rwanda genocide We do know why these rapes are happening but one thing is clear they are done to destroy women Mukwege said In some cases armed men brutalise villagers for food and loot in others they use rape as a weapon of war to force locals to accept the power and authorities of a particular armed group It can destroy entire communities Rape traumatises girls and women humiliates their husbands and can break up families Women become fearful of working in the fields and taking goods to sell at market reducing family incomes If they have been badly injured they may not be able to have more children Many who are raped are divorced by their husbands and lose their home Men who have been raped are sometimes divorced by their wives Local women groups offer shelters in local towns and help survivors learn new skills but their resources are limited In some cases survivors pool their resources and rent accommodation together Many Congolese women activists seeking to help survivors and highlight the issue internationally themselves become targets and receive death threats They and international aid agencies are urging for improved justice systems to deal with the perpetrators Although the majority of rapes are carried out by armed men there is a growing number carried out by civilians A survey by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiativeof women raped between 2004 and 2008 shows a 17-fold increase in the number of rapes by civilians The widespread impunity enjoyed by gunmen and security forces who have raped on a massive scale has led to the increase in sexual violence committed by civilians a investigative panel said in March 2011 

North Kivu and South Kivu North Kivu was the epicentre of Congo war and rebel groups and militias continue to fight for land and resources in this remote eastern region FDLR The main rebel group operating in the two provinces is the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda FDLR composed partly of Rwandan and Interahamwe militia who fled to Congo after participating in the 1994 genocide in their home country The FDLR are seen to be a root cause of the region lengthy conflict A series of military offensives against the rebel group has had mixed results Although it has reduced the number of FDLR fighters local civilians have been targeted in reprisal attacks and tens of thousands been forced to flee their homes Congo and neighbouring Rwanda launched a joint military offensive in January 2009 the most concerted pressure on the rebels for years Rwandan troops withdrew a month later FDLR fighters stepped up reprisals against villagers they accused of siding with their enemies and retook ground they lost during the offensive Tens of thousands fled their homes In March 2009 the army launched a second campaign Kimia II in North and South Kivu As before it caused mass displacement In November the Panel of Experts said Kimia II had failed to neutralise the FDLR and exacerbated the humanitarian crisis and the peacekeeping mission MONUC suspended cooperation with the army 213th brigade over its targeted killing of civilians during the campaign In December 2009 the operation was suspended A third operation Amani Leo was launched in January 2010 and narrowed the military campaign to FDLR command bases Human Rights Watch said Many more civilians were displaced in both Kivus as a result The number of FDLR fighters at the end of 2010 had fallen to 3,500 from 6,000 in 2009 according to estimates In February 2011 envoy to Congo Roger Meece said the FDLR was weakening because of a combination of judicial action in Europe against leaders of the group Security Council sanctions and military operations CNDP The joint military operation of January 2009 against the FDLR helped to neutralise another major rebel group the North National Congress of the Defence of the People CNDP The CNDP was formed in July 2006 by general Laurent Nkunda a former commander of the main rebel group that controlled the eastern part of the country during the Congolese war the Congolese Rally for Democracy RCD Nkunda traditional enemy was the FDLR A Tutsi born in North Kivu Nkunda said he wanted to protect fellow Congolese who speak Kinyarwanda a language of Rwandan origin The RCD initially united Hutus and Tutsis in North Kivu where both tribes speak Kinyarwanda He rejected conciliation with the government right through the 2006 election period but started integrating his 4,000 troops into the national army in February 2007 Brigades consisting of army soldiers and his rebels were established to pursue the Hutu militias Not everyone thought the deal allowing Nkunda into the army was a good thing The then Human Rights Commissioner Louise Arbour said it was a serious error Rights groups accused the brigades of rape arbitrary killings and systematic displacement of civilians By August 2007 the army had halted operations against Rwandan Hutu rebels in a bid to avoid further ethnic tension and Nkunda forces renewed attacks on the government army The negotiated a ceasefire in September but it fell apart a month later and clashes resumed The government Nkunda and several other rebel groups but not the FDLR signed a peace deal in January 2008 but by August this too had collapsed Nkunda launched a fresh offensive on army bases and areas under the formal protection of peacekeepers Nkunda rebellion peaked in late 2008 when he captured large swathes of territory and threatened North Kivu regional capital Goma forcing more than a quarter of a million people to flee their homes The army abandoned positions near Goma and looted and raped civilians in and around the city Intense international diplomatic pressure stopped Nkunda advancing further In January 2009 Nkunda was ousted by General Bosco Ntaganda who took command of the CNDP which pledged to abandon its insurgency raising fresh hopes for peace Later that month Nkunda was arrested in Rwanda on charges of war crimes Some of these alleged crimes have been documented by New Human Rights Watch which says his troops have carried out numerous killings torture and rapes See its October 2007 report Ntaganda has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for recruiting child soldiers to fight in Ituri province in 2002 and 2003 Despite this he is playing a prominent role in the army offensive against the FDLR according to Congolese army documents seen by Reuters in April 2009 and confirmed by him in an interview with Reuters in October 2010 CNDP fighters have officially been integrated into the army but rights groups say they maintain control of swathes of land and are extracting taxes and mining cassiterite and coltan Other armed groups MONUSCO and the Congolese army are also battling a Burundian Hutu rebel group the FNL Forces Nationales de Liberation which is recruiting hundreds of fighters in South Kivu the United Nations said in December 2010 Ugandan rebels Allied Democratic Army for the Liberation of Uganda are active in North Kivu and supported from abroad the rebels want to set up an Islamic state in Uganda Other groups include the Front for the Liberation of Congo FPLC which recruits former CNDP members disgruntled with the peace process It operates in a North Kivu and collaborates with FDLR and RUD splinter groups the Group of Experts on Congo said in its June 2011 report The Rally for Unity and Democracy an FDLR splinter group operates in North Kivu Congolese Mai Mai militias are also active in the Kivu looting and abducting locals Orientale Lord Resistance Army LRA rebels who terrorised northern Uganda for two decades crossed into the northeastern province of Orientale during 2005 They regularly attack rape and abduct villagers in the region Eight Guatemalan peacekeepers were killed in January 2006 when the United Nations launched a special operation to capture LRA Deputy Commander Vincent Otti Otti who was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court was killed by his own allies in late 2007 In December 2008 Uganda launched a military offensive backed by Congolese and South Sudanese troops against the LRA bases in Orientale The LRA responded by attacking local villages forcing tens of thousands to flee Katanga Violence in Congo most province has eased although there are still abuses carried out by both militias called Mai Mai and the local police and army especially in the lawless and remote north of the province The home province of President Kabila has a long history of unrest much of it provoked by wealth in mines that once produced 50 to 80 percent of the national budget Katanga was the site of a secessionist war in the 1960s and its politicians have been accused of trying to break away in more recent years The main conflicts were driven by tensions between the region north and south between natives and perceived outsiders and between the army and Mai Mai militiamen who ran amok committing widespread abuses and now extort money from civilians The Mai Mai was supported by the Congolese government during the war with Rwanda and Uganda After the war ended in 2003 the national government tried to integrate the Mai Mai into the national army but without success Mai Mai leaders became increasingly hostile to the government and took control of huge swathes of central Katanga fought their former allies the Congolese army and terrorized local communities A military court in Katanga convicted Mai Mai leader Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga in March 2009 of crimes against humanity In its landmark ruling the court also found the government liable for failing to disarm the Mai Mai militias and awarded damages to the victims The region where Gedeon operated became known as the triangle of death because of the suffering inflicted on civilians there In November 2005 the United Nations estimated 150,000 people had been forced to flee their homes and hundreds had been killed The global recession has had a huge impact on the province as demand for its minerals plummeted Local authorities estimated in March 2009 that 300,000 people lost their jobs almost overnight Thousands have fled there from violence in South Kivu Ituri The northeastern Ituri region was basically under Ugandan control throughout the war During their occupation which ran from 1998 to May 2003 Ugandan soldiers provided arms and military training to different ethnic groups fostering the spread of an initially limited land dispute between Hema and Lendu The Hema are pastoralists and the Lendu farmers but the majority of Ituri population are neither Hema nor Lendu says Human Rights Watch However they were all forced to take sides and became subject to attacks because of their perceived association with either Hema or Lendu groups During Congo war Uganda Rwanda and Congolese governments all supported different militia groups in Ituri Just when Congo was forming a transitional government in 2003 and embarking on its peace process Ituri was on the verge of genocide says the International Crisis Group The worst of the conflict raged for nearly a decade until a 2006 ceasefire led to a peace deal Since then most armed groups have been dismantled and former rebels integrated into the army or demobilised and the presence of peacekeepers and Congo army has helped contain other outbreaks of violence But the process could still be reversed analysts say Tensions remain over access to land and natural resource revenues including from gold and timber Some fear the presence of oil under Lake Albert which lies between Ituri and Uganda may spark further conflict And the return of thousands of displaced people many of whose homes have been occupied in their absence has also exacerbated There is little trust between the different communities and abuses committed during the conflict have for the most part gone unpunished Also the Congolese army continues to perpetrate human rights abuses in Ituri Remnants of militia groups carry out sporadic attacks against civilians and clash with the army These include the Front for Patriotic Resistance in Ituri FRPI and the Popular Front for Justice in Congo FPJC Thomas Lubanga leader of the ethnic Union of Congolese Patriots UPC militia was the first suspect to face trial at the International Criminal Court ICC accused of recruiting children during the UPC occupation of the regional capital Bunia between August 2002 and March 2003 Lubanga deputy during the Ituri wars Bosco Ntaganda is also wanted by the ICC Two warlords from the other side of the Ituri conflict Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo are accused by ICC prosecutors of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder sexual slavery rape inhumane acts and recruiting child soldiers Katanga also known as Simba or lion led the Patriotic Forces of Resistance of Ituri FRPI while Ngudjolo headed the allied Front of Nationalists and Integrationalists FPI militia Human Rights Watchtracked who was who in Ituri armed groups in 2003 Followers of Bundu dia Kongo BDK reject central authority over the western province and are campaigning for the of the Kongo kingdom which encompassed parts of Angola Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon More than 100 people died in a January 2007 crackdown on the BDK and dozens of BDK supporters died in clashes with police in early 2008 The police attempted to hide the extent of the carnage by dumping bodies in the Congo River and hastily burying others in mass graves says Human Rights Watch The government revoked the authorisation of the BDK to operate as a social and cultural organisation that same month effectively making it illegal There little presence on the ground since more than 90 percent of its troops are in the east but additional troops were sent in for a few months to help restore peace Equateur Ethnic tensions in this northwestern province dating back to the colonial era flared in October 2009 with clashes between two Lobala tribes the Enyele and the Manzaya following a dispute over fishing and farming rights peacekeepers and the national army took control of the area in December enabling aid agencies to reach those in need but fresh clashes broke out in April 2010 when the Movement of Liberation and Allies MILIA stormed the provincial capital Mbandaka Nearly 200,000 were displaced between October 2009 and mid April 2010 including at least 114,000 who fled across the river to the Republic of Congo about 18,000 who took refuge in Central African Republic and many others who were displaced internally according to estimates Although security has improved since then tensions remain

A powerful cyclone tore across parts of coastal Bangladesh and eastern India on May 25 triggering tidal surges and flooding that killed at least 275 people and left millions marooned by floodwater or forced to take refuge in shelters Officials and aid workers said they feared the death toll from Cyclone Aila could rise due to epidemics from contaminated floodwaters in the cyclone aftermath Army navy and coastguards helped civil officials and volunteers search for the missing and pick up people marooned in hundreds of villages caught in chest or waters The authorities in Bangladesh moved some half a million people to temporary shelters after they fled their homes to escape huge tidal waves churned by winds of up to 100 kph 60 mph Heavy rain triggered by the storm also raised river levels and burst mud embankments in the Sundarbans delta in the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal The affected area is home to hundreds of thousands of people as well as the world biggest tiger reserve Many of the dead drowned were killed when their houses collapsed or were crushed by uprooted trees Witnesses said many survivors faced a shortage of food and drinking water The cyclone destroyed large areas of crops in both countries Storm surges washed away dozens of shrimp farms and inundated rice fields in Bangladesh which is battered by storms every year Aila ripped through many areas still recovering from Cyclone Sidr in November 2007 which killed 3,500 people in Bangladesh and left at least a million homeless

Tropical East Africa customarily has two rainy seasons each year from around March to May and October to December But experts say climate change is making rainfall increasingly unreliable and in 2007 heavy rains came at odd times When fresh floods arrived in 2007 the region was still recovering from widespread flooding during the 2006 rainy season The 2006 emergency affected more than 1.5 million people mainly in Somalia Ethiopia Eritrea and Sudan Even before that many people in the region were already struggling to get by following a regional drought in 2005-2006 that killed a large proportion of livestock and left nomadic herders dependent on food aid These extremes of weather are exactly what have been predicted commented Andrew Pendleton senior climate policy analyst at Christian Aid in September 2007 Long dry periods followed by short torrential rainy spells are creating havoc Harvests are being destroyed with the result people are no longer able to feed themselves The situation is only going to get worse unless we take action now In the period of 2007 the East African countries most affected by flooding are Uganda Sudan Ethiopia and Kenya In central Africa Rwanda Chad and Central African Republic have also experienced damaging floods although on a lesser scale Uganda and Sudan are bearing the brunt with around 300,000 people affected in Uganda and more than half a million in Sudan Across the regions homes roads and bridges have been washed away Food stocks crops and livestock have been destroyed creating food shortages and damaging people ability to make a living A shortage of clean drinking water has raised the threat of waterborne diseases Aid agencies have launched appeals for extra funds to cope with the emergency The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has also stressed the need for efforts to help African countries cope with flooding Not only must we and our partners bring emergency food shelter and access to safe water to people in dire need but we must also plan and finance sustainable disaster preparedness measures such as prepositioning stocks building bore holes and wells setting up local emergency communications systems as well as increasing the numbers of Red Cross volunteers trained in disaster management techniques said IFRC operations coordinator for Africa Niels Scott in a statement

The vast majority of east Africans depend on crops and livestock to survive in what is mostly arid or land In the 1970s the region was a net exporter of food but it now experiences repeated food shortages In November 2009 more than 20 million people in the region needed food aid including 6.2 million in Ethiopia 3.8 million in Kenya and 3.6 million in Somalia Recurring drought also affects Uganda and Sudan both of which experience varying levels of violence and Djibouti and Tanzania People are surviving on two litres of water a day in some places less water than a toilet flush The conditions have never been so harsh or so inhospitable Oxfam East Africa Director Paul Smith Lomas said in September 2009 Rains have become less predictable and wet seasons in the region are shorter Droughts which used to occur once a decade now happen every two or three years says Oxfam Floods which usually follow periods of drought and high food prices exacerbate the problem In the longer term the lack of suitable pastures means that nomadic herders will increasingly struggle to feed their livestock and earn less income to buy staple foods such as maize or sorghum In addition reproduction rates of livestock have suffered from successive poor seasonal rains since 2007 according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation When crisis strikes an international response is usually triggered to address acute hunger But the response is often too slow and once the immediate danger of people dying has passed the aid ends without addressing underlying problems and effects on health and livelihoods says the International Food Policy Research Institute IFPRI The region government responses to emergencies are often dogged by corruption and a lack of resources and expertise says IFPRI ETHIOPIA Ethiopia is still struggling to feed its people years after it suffered a devastating famine in 1984-85 which killed million Ethiopians An estimated 7.2 million people receive cash handouts or food aid from the government every year to stave off hunger During a food crisis millions more may need help International appeals usually only include the additional millions not already dependent on food aid The impact of poor rains is exacerbated by conflicts which flare up regularly There are two separatist insurgencies as well as conflicts caused by disputes over scarce water and grazing land and administrative boundaries In September 2009 there were conflicts in at least five of Ethiopia nine regions followed by widespread displacement says the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre KENYA Drought floods high maize prices and conflict have pushed hundreds of thousands of people into extreme hunger Those most affected are families in Kenya pastoral and marginal agricultural areas the urban poor and people displaced during the conflict that broke out after President Mwai Kibaki disputed at the end of 2007 Pastoralists have also been affected by the low price of livestock See AlertNet Kenya briefing SOMALIA Somalia is facing its worst humanitarian crisis since 1991 when warlords toppled military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre the leader of the country last functioning government Fighting between government troops and Islamist rebels has caused massive displacement Combined with drought and flash floods it has made life miserable for millions already struggling with high inflation and global and regional rises in fuel and food costs More than a third of the population is in need of emergency food aid See AlertNet Somalia briefing SUDAN Millions of displaced people who returned home in south Sudan after the end of the country civil war in 2005 are still struggling to rebuild their lives The region has very little infrastructure left after the war and increased fighting in the region is once again driving many out of their homes Millions more in the country western Darfur region have been displaced by years of war and depend on food aid Both regions are affected by drought See alertNet Sudan briefing

Remarks by USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah in Sukkur Pakistan I would like to start by thanking you for coming and I have been deeply moved by the things I have seen and heard here in Sukkur and in the heart of Sindh along the banks of the Indus River about the impact that these floods have had on the people of Pakistan The waters of the Indus River have nurtured civilization for 5000 years of recorded history Today I have also seen and met with the families who suffered the terrible damage that these waters have recently done This has caused not just a humanitarian crisis but as you drive along the roadside and see the destruction of agriculture and death of livestock one recognizes this also is a tremendous economic and social catastrophe We know that twenty million Pakistanis have been affected by these tragic floods and we know that more than 20 percent of all cropland in this country is underwater Farmers are without crop livestock have been wiped out the winter planting season rapidly coming upon us is in serious jeopardy We met today with children who are hungry and who are not currently in schools and we know that mothers are currently lacking access to necessary urgent maternal healthcare Waters are polluted and illness is a tremendous threat to the entire population Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with the United Nations organizations cluster leads that are providing urgent support to Pakistan and urgent leadership sector by sector Over 1.8 million people have received initial 30 day rations of food from the World Food Program more than half of that has been provided through partnership with the United States The sectors are working aggressively to meet the needs and are clearly scaling up their response efforts as quickly as they possibly can I also met with General Nadeem and the National Disaster Management Authority staff This is the first natural disaster in Pakistan where NDMA led by General Nadeem has been in clear charge of the entire response effort USAID is proud to be working with General Nadeem and his team who are doing an outstanding job in very difficult circumstances In fact USAID has helped provide resources to set up and support the National Disaster Management Authority We continue to provide support to allow General Nadeem to have the capacity staff and capability to save as many lives as possible evacuate communities and provide support to communities that have been affected by the floods We had the chance yesterday to travel with General Nadeem by helicopter over the flooded Swat Valley and we saw bridge after bridge that had been washed out by the floods stranding more than 600,000 people in the region So many of these people were displaced only a year ago by terrorism and had recently returned home only to suffer from this natural disaster Today touring devastation in this region I am both saddened by the extent of the catastrophe and also deeply impressed by the commitment and valor of the dedicated international and local relief workers who are doing their best to meet human needs But let me be clear This disaster presents a major logistical challenge Simply getting food water items such as hygiene kits and a range of other items to the needy populations will be a significant challenge in the days and weeks to come We are committed to supporting as significant a relief effort as is possible and our focus on a day to day basis is to ensure that the relief effort is larger exists at greater scale is more efficient and is able to meet greater needs every single day We are carrying a message with us for the people of Pakistan As you begin to recover from this disaster America including the United States Agency for International Development and all of the other parts of our government stand with you The American people are committed to humanitarian response We believe in the moral calling of saving lives when it is possible to do so and we are fully committed to this effort That is why just last week Secretary Clinton and I joined the United Nations General Assembly and announced a 150 million support package just for the immediate relief effort that has taken place and it is why we continue to try to expand our efforts every single day Today in southern Pakistan I am pleased to announce that the United States will redirect an additional 50 million of assistance from our Kerry Lugar Berman Assistance portfolio to aid Pakistanis in early recovery efforts such as the things we started to see here in the camps We will continue to closely monitor and assess the situation and will look for ways that we can most immediately and effectively benefit the people of Pakistan There no question that as this effort transitions from meeting basic needs in the immediate relief period to an early recovery period that is focused on supporting the resiliency of local markets helping people get back on their feet supporting local cash for work programs so that they can support themselves and build viable local economies that we will need to take steps that fulfill our commitment to the people of Pakistan and do what is ever most appropriate and most effective to really help people recover We will consult closely with Pakistan leadership We have been engaged in an important and significant strategic dialogue since the beginning of this Administration Secretary Clinton and President Obama remain committed to that dialogue as a vehicle for us to have the type of consultation and partnership that cuts across a broad range of issues and allows us to work in real partnership on behalf of the people of Pakistan As hard as it is to image a future in the face of the devastation that we see today and we see all around Pakistan as a result of the floods we believe that this also presents an opportunity to build back a stronger and better and more resilient Pakistani economy After the tragic earthquake in 2005 that killed almost 80,000 Pakistanis USAID committed itself to rebuilding schools on behalf of those affected communities We rebuilt 56 schools that serve more than 20,000 students and we built them to a high earthquake standard that we in fact had the chance to see as we flew over some of them yesterday That just one example of how we can work together to build back a stronger and more capable Pakistan that provides better services to its people and takes seriously the risk reduction that we need to put in place so that future natural disasters simply do cause the kind of tragedy that we have seen today and that we have seen in the recent floods So I thank you for being here I thank you for joining us in the visits to the camps ultimately those visits for me were a unique opportunity to speak with listen to and learn from the people we are trying to serve I take back with me a real sense of commitment because what they been through has been horrendous and we want to do everything we possibly can to help them rebuild their lives Thank you 

Ambassador Concerned About Protecting Every Pakistani Briefing on Flood Relief Efforts at the US Embassy in Islamabad Ambassador Patterson Thank you Rick Good afternoon Pakistan is facing a disaster of enormous proportions but we do not yet know the full scope of its impact The unusually heavy monsoon rains created a wall of water running downstream successively flooding communities along the river There are at least three waves that have been created and it has not stopped raining Monsoons here usually continue until We have all heard the statistics The UN says by a conservative estimate some 14 million people have been affected by the flood and that at least half million require humanitarian assistance The Secretary General has launched an international appeal for 459 million dollars Secretary of State Clinton is planning to attend a special session of the UN General Assembly on Thursday and to speak about Pakistan crisis there The United States is asking governments around the world to attend the special session at the highest level possible on short notice in a show of support for Pakistan The United States has responded immediately and generously to Pakistan call for assistance following the tragic and devastating floods that began July 29 To date the has pledged to provide approximately 76 million in assistance to populations in Pakistan Over 30 million of that assistance has already been contracted to NGO partners here in Pakistan who are implementing relief for people here This is far more than any other country has contributed but that only tells part of the story The United States has unique capabilities that no other nation in the world can match Immediately following the government of Pakistan request we had government helicopters in country to begin supporting relief efforts The Department of Defense has brought a growing number of air assets from Afghanistan and from a ship in the Arabian Sea to support the Pakistan government The American people can be proud of our fine service personnel who are doing an outstanding job ferrying about 515,000 tons of equipment and food and rescuing more than 4600 stranded people We estimate that these contributions food water purification plants bridges and aircraft operations have brought the total of assistance cash and to over 87 million and this amount is growing every day The American private sector is also beginning to step up and we have seen a number of donations start to come in from major American corporations You can see the details on your fact sheets The community has begun to hold fundraisers and appeals on behalf of flood relief American citizens have been texting the word Swat on their cell phones to 50555 to make a 10 contribution Ladies and gentlemen of the press Pakistan is facing a historic crisis The United States is channeling all elements of our substantial national abilities money unique contributions and our private sector to help the people of Pakistan Everything we are doing is in full partnership with the government of Pakistan and in support of the government efforts to bring about a quick recovery for the people of Pakistan We are well aware that many people remain in crisis There is not yet enough food or shelter for the many people affected by this disaster The human suffering caused by this flood has been great and while we are talking today about the big picture of disaster relief and assistance we want you to know that we are concerned about protecting every Pakistani Our purpose in inviting you here today is to try to give you a picture of what is taking place and where we are going Our mission team and our senior leadership in Washington has been working over the past few weeks to help Pakistan I will ask some of my senior staff to brief you but also I want to acknowledge the presence here today of some of our very important NGO partners who will also brief you on the work they are doing on the ground across the country So first you will hear from Vice Admiral Mike LeFever the head of our Office of the Defense Representative who will describe our significant contributions to emergency rescue and relief Admiral LeFever was the key DoD official here during the 2005 earthquake Then you will hear from Bill Berger USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team Leader Bill will describe how the international community is moving in to support NDMA Bill was also here during the 2005 earthquake Bob Wilson the head of the USAID Mission will describe the funds we are programming to our NGO partners My staff will do their best to make crisp presentations so that we can get to your questions but before we begin I want to reiterate that the government is doing everything it can to support Pakistan rescue and relief operations Our activities are in complete with the NDMA and the Pakistan military We are painfully aware that many people are continuing to experience hardships in Pakistan We have made this humanitarian mission our absolute top priority to save lives and help stabilize Pakistan The United States was here supporting Pakistan as a partner before the flood and we will continue to support Pakistan into the future Thank you Admiral LeFever VADM LeFever Good afternoon First let me express my sincere condolences to all those who have lost family and friends during these terrible floods throughout Pakistan We mourn with you and support you as you and your nation bravely confronts this tragedy As many may be aware this is the second time in my military career that I been in a position to assist our Pakistani friends during a natural disaster Just as we were during the earthquake relief operations in 2005 and 2006 the United States is here once again to help We are committed to providing the assistance requested by the government of Pakistan and to aid the people of Pakistan in their time of need While support is very much a endeavor our military provides a unique capability to rapidly deliver much needed aid and assistance Over the last 18 days our response to this terrible disaster has been immediate Only 36 hours into the flooding military cargo aircraft had already begun aid flights delivering 436,000 Halala for distribution by Pakistan authorities Six military helicopters were dispatched shortly thereafter to begin the urgent relief flights in partnership with the Pakistan military By the end of this week we have a total of 19 helicopters in Pakistan providing support and more are on the way soon to help deliver supplies to areas cut off by the floods Since arriving these helicopter crews and their Pakistan military counterparts have rescued more than 3500 people and have delivered more than 436,000 pounds of relief supplies Yesterday Air Force began assisting the Pakistan government with transport of international from warehouses here in Islamabad to the required locations throughout Pakistan in hubs that Bill Berger will mention that General Nadeem at the NDMA has a plan for We delivered just yesterday alone 52,000 pounds of supplies I would encourage you to read the Embassy fact sheet which has more about these efforts and the overall efforts in Pakistan The humanitarian assistance effort to aid Pakistan is very personal to me The wonderful relationships and friendships I developed with so many Pakistanis during the years in Pakistan have endeared me to your country Together as friends and partners we will continue to stand beside you the people and the government of Pakistan as you courageously tackle this enormous challenge laid before us Thank you I now be followed by Bill Berger DART team leader Berger Thank you Admiral LeFever Let me join the Ambassador and Admiral LeFever in conveying our condolences to the people of Pakistan in this hour of great need The current situation as the Ambassador mentioned over 14 million people have been affected by the flood from these unprecedented monsoon rains For us help is a top priority and shelter water and food are also in short supply According to Pakistan National Disaster Management Authority NDMA the devastation left by the flood waters in the north of the country may worsen as water surges south to the Sindh Province We working closely with the government of Pakistan with the NDMA Chairman Nadeem and the international NGOs UN agencies and Pakistan humanitarian organizations What we doing Here are our priorities To date as the Ambassador mentioned the has provided 87 million in financial and humanitarian assistance This is just the beginning The efforts will grow in the days and weeks ahead The demand now has shifted from rescuing those stranded to providing food water and shelter to those who have lost their homes and their livelihoods and in the aftermath of floods one thing we always concerned about is disease control and prevention Pakistan has been flooded from north to south Millions of families have lost their livelihoods and seen homes shops schools and crops flattened and washed away USAID is providing safe drinking water for approximately 36,000 people We delivered six water filtration units each capable of providing clean water to 10,000 people a day Those were shipped within the very first hours of the onset of flooding because we knew that waterborne disease would always be a problem in flooding Water tinkering and restoration of wells in KPK Sindh Balochistan and Punjab Provinces are priorities in things that we are providing assistance for now We expanding activities in regions in the south including Sindh Punjab Balochistan Provinces where there has been little humanitarian presence until now Health as I said is a vital concern Where waters are receding USAID is expanding health efforts to prevent malaria and an outbreak of waterborne diseases and respiratory infections that commonly occur in flooding Because we know waterborne illnesses can lead to severe dehydration and death without proper treatment and prevention preventing and containing a disease outbreak is vital in this response USAID has provided funding to establish more than 15 Diarrhea Treatment Centers located in high risk areas Through the Disease Early Warning System of WHO funded in part by USAID since 2008 we will know as communicable infections and diseases appear in the areas USAID is also supporting local health facilities through the World Health Organization and NGO partners and expanding the Disease Early Warning System and developing more health facilities diarrhea treatment centers and district hospitals in areas Radio and text messaging networks have been set up to get out information about the importance of good hygiene and washing of hands People are going door to door to convey the importance of boiling water hand washing and proper sanitation USAID has flown in five flights of high quality plastic sheeting and shelter kit materials to construct emergency shelters for 115,900 people The plastic sheeting is so durable that people affected by the earthquake that were provided this plastic sheeting still are using this today USAID Office of Food for Peace has provided more than 15.4 million to the UN World Food Program primarily for the local and regional purchase of food aid and the dispatch of commodities from USAID prepositioned site in Djibouti USAID Food for Peace has provided 4.1 million for food vouchers to enable flood victims to purchase food in their local markets As the waters recede we be here helping the people of Pakistan We will work with the government of Pakistan on the reconstruction efforts including credit facilities to put purchasing power back in the hands of Pakistani people cash for work and employment programs to clear debris and we perform basic activities in areas and provide building materials seeds and tools so that when people return they can reestablish their livelihoods We working closely with General Nadem and his team at the NDMA They working diligently under the incredible pressure of the enormous needs of the people affected by the flooding They set up a hub and spoke distribution system covering all of the affected areas Also they have put in place a process for national and assistance to quickly and effectively reach those in need We supporting their efforts with every resource at our disposal Thank you very much Now I like to introduce Bob Wilson who the Director of USAID in Pakistan Wilson Good afternoon Thank you Bill In addition to the efforts of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance that Bill just outlined USAID development assistance portfolio is also stepping up to provide additional support to the relief efforts and planning for considerable reconstruction and recovery efforts once the floods recede Our ongoing livelihoods programs and small scale community infrastructure programs health education programs are providing support currently to needy communities I like to mention that in addition to the international organizations that USAID and OFDA are supporting we also supporting local organizations and NGOs We have recently initiated grants to the Poverty Alleviation Fund which is an association of over 82 local NGOs and we also working with the Rural Support Program Network in many areas of the country areas of the country We also providing support to the coordination efforts of the NDMA through the ION We also responsible for the bulk of the Bill implementation Our spend plan under has significant health water agriculture infrastructure finance local government and education resources which can be reoriented to priority recovery and reconstruction needs once the floods recede Lastly I like to recognize the presence of Manuel Bessler the head of OCHA and Wolfgang Harbinger the head of WFP here and I believe we ready to answer questions Question I would like to ask you these days there a lot of talk about Pakistan facing a credibility crisis and image problem with regards to receiving the foreign donations Is that a consideration for the when it gives Pakistan aid or donations for the flood affectees Thank you Ambassador Patterson The short answer is no The will funnel its assistance through a variety of mechanisms including the government of Pakistan We going to provide money resources to NDMA through the UN organizations with which we have a longstanding relationship through international NGOs and private voluntary organizations and as Wilson just explained a wide variety of local NGOs who have reached into the rural and isolated parts of the country We have confidence in the government ability to deliver and we will work with all these mechanisms to try and ensure that every single Pakistani gets the relief that he or she deserves Question The 87 million you talked about flood assistance to Pakistan so far So I just want to know about the How much you contributed to United Nations how much to the NGOs or USAID and how much through government of Pakistan Thank you Ambassador Patterson I going to ask Berger to write that down but let me say as an overall approach to our aid program we are funneling more money through the government of Pakistan We given 180 million this year alone to the Benazir Income Support Fund which of course is a program for poor people 90 million to the Higher Education Commission All of this in cash 45 million for IDP relief And 65 million for housing for victims of the Swat crisis So we are trying to funnel as much money as possible through the government but I let Berger give you the of the 78 million Berger 15.4 million of that is a program through Food for Peace and that largely went to WFP OFDA has basically programmed to date a little over 30 million and that divided among the UN agencies local NGOs and the INGO community to rapidly get resources to people on the ground There also a DoD contribution in there We can get you the exact breakdown later I do have it in front of me now Question My question is presently the inaudible is terribly inaudible and it is inaudible in Pakistan So what is the strategy or agency or is adopting to help those people who are really facing a famine situation there Thank you VADM LeFever Let me try to answer that question We working very closely with NDMA and the Pakistan military As you know the Pakistan Air Force is I think programming three flights a day up into Gilgit and in that area They have given us planning factors that they have requested six to assist in the distribution of the aid to include in this hub and spoke going up to Gilgit and Skardhu to be able to deliver diesel fuel and cooking fuel as well as relief supplies up into that area because as you know the KKH is washed out So we look very much forward to joining in on the deliveries with the Pakistan Air Force as they deliver supplies into that area We are also today at the request of the Pakistan Army in addition to the heavy lift high altitude Chinooks and that are operating up in the Swat Valley they asked us to start going up toward the KKH highway delivering supplies and evacuating those that are affected So the Pakistan government has a very good plan knows the resources has given us planning factors that we can work with putting bladders on the to be able to deliver fuel as well as the drums that the Pakistan Air Force is already doing They are very acutely aware of that issue and are doing great things planned by the NDMA as well as the Pakistan military Question My question is to the Ambassador How much is it to portion of the helicopter flights being diverted to western Punjab inaudible and the Balochistan Because we have seen so far as yet VADM LeFever Currently the NDMA and the Pakistan Army has had my helicopters up in the area working relief efforts up in the Swat Valley As we bring in more helicopters these assets will be available and we working in close cooperation with NDMA and the Pak military to distribute those air assets as required for those folks that are in need Question I just want to ask that United Nations had asked the donors to provide 459 million to Pakistan for relief for immediate relief But the response is very slow What are the reasons for this Another thing the Americans and UK Ambassadors and High Commissioners are also asking Pakistan to generate domestic revenues to meet this challenge What is your view on reform GST Ambassador Patterson On the issue of donations to the UN we have made a donation to the UN appeal which just came out a couple of days ago and I think I can say with confidence that our donation will increase rather substantially in the next few days Let me point out generally speaking that the United States is overwhelmingly the largest donor to WFP UNHCR WHO the UN agencies And during the IDP crisis in Swat the United States provided over 400 million Again we were overwhelmingly the largest donor to that crisis as well Most of that went through UN agencies On your question of taxes yes the United States thinks that taxed revenue should be increased here There are a lot of wealthy people who do pay sufficient taxes and they should contribute their fair share Berger I also like to point out we are contributing to the UN appeal and we looking at the programs there the UN plan and we looking at how we can increase our donations Please also remember that before that plan came out USAID was already programming money through NGO partners that we already had on the ground here and looking at new partners so we were already programming our money before the plan even came out So we have significant money that was already on the ground when the plan came in Question My question is about the irrigation channels and the power plants which were already damaged due to the heavy floods Is there any assistance the United States is providing to once again manage all these irrigation channels and the power plants over there Especially in southern Punjab Ambassador Patterson When the Secretary was here of course she announced a new energy package that included irrigation and dams and in next year this year budget actually we have over 450 million for infrastructure much of it in power plants and dams A lot of that will have to be redirected to this flood damage but we do have a very substantial budget and we been working vigorously with your government on identifying the proper use of those funds but we do expect to be a very significant contributor to both the early recovery and the reconstruction Question I was just wondering about whether you guys are concerned about whether the military focus on dealing with the flooding is going to take away from efforts against insurgency and the Taliban militants and how you guys are advising the Pak Mil here on how they should approach both things Ambassador Patterson We been in constant contact with the military over the past few days on an hourly basis I would say on flood relief And yes of course that what makes it so difficult is the insurgency is still ongoing These insurgents are still attacking politicians in and committing atrocities elsewhere in the country and yes I sure it a concern not only of the government but of every Pakistani that these missions be allowed to that have sufficient resources to continue Bessler I just wanted quickly to use the opportunity because it was mentioned before the appeal that was launched on behalf of the humanitarian country team last week for 459 million At this point we are funded 38 percent so we have in bank 254 million and pledged another 68 million That means with the pledges that hopefully come through we should be halfway through Certain classes are better funded others are a bit less funded We have still an issue on health Health is only 13 percent funded so they need a bit more just to compliment the comments before Question Inaudible the UNGA is meeting to discuss this issue As you say you are leading this effort for assistance what is the planning of the United States when it is represented by Secretary Clinton over there Thank you Ambassador Patterson Actually it was an initiative of the government of Pakistan to hold this special session of the General Assembly They reached out to the President of the General Assembly and then they urged their supporters like Secretary Clinton to attend I would want to jump ahead of the Secretary but I think it will be a very impressive international event with the attendance of many high level leaders from around the world with the attendance of leaders from the NGO community and very importantly in the United States representatives of the community As many of you know these people have prospered in the United States and are very engaged in philanthropy here in Pakistan and have the capacity to donate generously to the flood crisis here So all three things will be underway simultaneously in New York in an effort to raise revenue raise money for flood relief Question The situation in Pakistan inaudible throughout this crisis Do you think it will have any negative impact on the war on terror particularly in Pakistan are regrouping militants It would have any impact in regrouping in the militants and the government of Pakistan contribution to this crisis Ambassador Patterson We do know what impact it having on the insurgents That the short answer to that Of course like every other citizen American Pakistani and otherwise who are quite concerned about the insurgency which has taken a terrible toll on Pakistan and the idea that this flood would essentially come on top of a very corrosive insurgency is extremely worrisome This indicates the need for international support and widespread support for the people of Pakistan We in the United States are trying to do our part to provide that support Question A lot say that disasters can be opportunities I guess what I like to know is what are some of the decisions the hard decisions that Pakistan perhaps has made in the past like building dams things like that or anything else that you think maybe the government should take now in the face of this crisis What are some of the things they need to do to prevent this from ever happening again Ambassador Patterson I ca speculate on what the government needs to do Let me just assure you that we be working with them as are the international donors The ADB and the World Bank have already sent a team here to evaluate the next steps the early recovery and the long term reconstruction costs These processes always bring forward answers to the question that you just asked how to build back better I know there are a lot of international and domestic experts experts here in Pakistan who are working on just that issue and thinking about the question you raised There are a number of international meetings planned over the next few months where this is going to be discussed in some detail Question How would you see the donation collection here in Pakistan locally And what do you think will be the impact of this As it is said most of the extremist organizations are collecting the relief and also they are very active in distributing helping the people like they were in the earthquake as well What do you see What will be the impact of this Berger That a great question What I would like to address is when I was here during the earthquake for the seven months during the earthquake that was also a challenge There were hundreds of NGOs that had come to Pakistan to assist in their time of need and I think there is a mix of alleged charities that have other needs that they looking at in the collection of their revenues But I would like to think during this time when people are so in need much like they were in the earthquake that it here to support the people of Pakistan in their time of need Ambassador Patterson Let me say that to put it bluntly I think these stories about extremist organizations being the only players out there are greatly exaggerated We been deluged with requests from funding from very respected domestic NGOs They all over the country You can go to the web site that USAID put up to see some of those that we working with We identified 60 NGOs in southern Punjab alone many of which are community based and have excellent reach into rural areas of the country So frankly we not too concerned about the role of extremist charities because we think the people of Pakistan have a lot of domestic NGOs that are very active and very reputable Question My question is in 2005 when the earthquake his Pakistan the was the first to reach and get involved in the rescue and relief operation and that created a lot of good image for America in Pakistan Again in these floods we see that Americans are again the first who came here and started immediate relief operation and now heavily involved engaged throughout Pakistan But unfortunately in 2005 soon after the relief activities the military hit a mosque in the tribal area Again there was a lot of uproar against the Americans throughout the country So we heard that a few days back there was a drone attack I think in Mirancha in Waziristan So already the the government of the United States and the people are doing well in creating good will and a good image in Pakistan So can we expect that these drone attacks will be for a time being will be delayed and the Army would be working in coordination with the Pakistan military instead of directly hitting the targets in Pakistan Ambassador Patterson The is working with the

The 7.0 magnitude quake that rocked Haiti on Jan 12 2010 was the biggest urban disaster in modern history More than 316,000 people were killed Prime Minister Bellerive said in January 2011 revising previous estimates of around 250,000 Another 1.5 million were left homeless The tremor struck 15km 10 miles southwest of the capital and was the most powerful to hit the impoverished country in more than 200 years It was quickly followed by a series of strong aftershocks of up to 5.9 magnitude Thousands of homes schools and hospitals were destroyed as well as the headquarters in the presidential palace and the main prison Estimates of damage and losses range between and 14 billion A year after the quake most of those made homeless are still living in tents and makeshift shelters in which is still filled with rubble and wrecked buildings On top of this a raging cholera epidemic that started in in an area unaffected by the quake has spread across the country killing more than 3,600 people and infecting tens of thousands more Meanwhile a dispute over Haitis chaotic presidential elections in November has sparked violent protests and left the country in limbo raising fears that donors may delay handing over billions of dollars of aid INITIAL RESPONSE The aid response was hampered from the start by the scale of the devastation The quake destroyed much of the area limited infrastructure the main port was unable to function for several days roads were destroyed and there was a massive shortage of fuel to transport relief to the needy Those best placed to organise a response the government United Nations and aid agencies based in Haiti had lost staff offices and computers in the quake Thousands of homeless fled to other parts of the country but many settled in improvised camps around the capital In the first few weeks after the disaster the camps lacked food water decent shelter and medical care An estimated 4,000 people had to have limbs amputated some because they did not receive medical attention in time Security was also a concern The United States sent thousands of additional troops to help maintain law and order and deliver aid and the United Nations boosted its peacekeeping force In January the United Nations launched a flash appeal for 575 million in emergency aid The response was overwhelming and contributions and pledges poured in In February the United Nations launched its largest ever humanitarian appeal for 1.44 billion RECOVERY EFFORTS The pressing issue now is how to provide solid shelter for the homeless assessments said 105,000 homes were destroyed and 208,000 were damaged creating what experts have estimated as at least 20 million cubic meters of rubble probably more Aid agency Oxfam says that is enough to stretch more than halfway around the world if placed in dump trucks parked bumper to bumper But while donors have provided funds for transitional housing theyve stumped up little for clearing rubble and repairing homes Only a fraction of the debris had been removed by early 2011 Few damaged houses have been repaired and only 15 percent of the basic and temporary new housing required has been built Oxfam said in a critical report marking the anniversary The rebuilding process is also hampered by disputes over land ownership which may take years to resolve Before building work can even start the government and aid agencies need to determine who owns what land a major challenge after the earthquake killed some 16,000 civil servants and destroyed title deeds and land registry records Even before the quake land ownership was a thorny issue in Haiti contributing to violence and poverty in a country where land is concentrated in the hands of a few big landowners known as grandons Few Haitians own land titles and there is no proper land registry system with most titles passed down orally from one generation to the next CAMPS Around million people are still homeless Most are living in some 1,200 camps dotted around the city It is common to find six to ten people crammed into tents for two More than half of children living in the camps do not go to school Rape is a major problem in the camps Hundreds of cases have been reported since the quake according to a report by Amnesty International It says the lack of security and policing in and around the camps is a big factor behind the increase in attacks over the past year Armed gangs roam the camps after dark often breaking into tents or attacking girls and women when they go to the toilet THE AID OPERATION Rescue medical and relief workers from around the globe began pouring into Haiti hours after the earthquake struck Experts say well over billion was quickly raised for the emergency response in what Oxfam calls unprecedented generosity shown by the world for Haiti It says this response saved countless lives by providing water sanitation shelter food aid and other vital assistance to millions The World Food Programme is helping close to million Haitians with school meals nutrition and work programs No deaths from hunger have been reported However the aid operation has also been strongly criticised for a lack of coordination perhaps not surprising given that the response has brought together a struggling Haitian government a plethora of agencies other governments from around the world and a multitude of charities that some estimate at more than 10,000 Of the thousands of charities working in Haiti only 450 are formally registered with the government and only 150 regularly send reports to the planning ministry as required by law Prime Minister Bellerive often complains that many charities in Haiti bypass the government in their operations some offering no reporting or accountability at all Before leaving Haiti late last year the former Organization of American States OAS representative Ricardo Seitenfus accused some humanitarian organisations of using the country as a laboratory and an opportunity to do business The BBC reports that some people simply can not afford to leave the camps because foreign aid workers have pushed up rents Presidential adviser Jean Renald Clerisme who has one of Haiti best paid jobs said he was being asked 2,000 for rent on a house he wanted to move to more than half his salary When you have foreigners the price goes up and the local can not afford to pay he told the BBC Aside from pushing up rents Clerisme said foreign aid workers were actually encouraging more people to live in camps by concentrating nearly all their services around them Others say the influx of medical charities has undermined Haitis healthcare system with many medical staff quitting to take up better paid jobs with international agencies The availability of free medical care has meanwhile forced pharmacists out of business and doctors have lost their patients An influx of free food has similarly undercut local agriculture according to Oxfam FUNDING RECONSTRUCTION Damages and losses from the Haitian earthquake were evaluated at 7.9 billion according to the World Bank although estimates from other sources give higher figures At a major donors conference in New York in March 2010 donors pledged 5.3 billion to support Haiti reconstruction and development in 2010-2011 and nearly 11 billion for the next five years A disaster management body was set up in April by former President Bill Clinton the special envoy for Haiti and by Prime Minister Bellerive The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission decides which reconstruction projects to fund and will operate for 18 months before handing over to a government redevelopment authority The money is being administered through a Trust Fund supervised by the World Bank Ahead of the anniversary the World Bank vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean Pamela Cox said almost half the promised 5.3 billion about 2.6 billion had been approved in donors budgets She said pressure should be kept on bilateral donors who promised more resources and have not delivered them yet One major concern for donors is corruption which is rife in Haiti particularly in the construction sector BUILDING BACK Haiti faces a threat of further earthquakes One of the geophysicists who warned Haitian officials in 2008 there could be a 7.2 magnitude quake on the horizon has said another major earthquake may be triggered by January tremor experts and aid agencies are urging the government and donors to commit to building earthquake and schools hospitals and houses They say this would add less than 10 percent to building costs and save countless lives in the future Before the quake Haiti sprawling capital was littered with shoddy buildings due to poor construction standards and inadequate building regulations Many homes were built on steep slopes and unstable foundations Training people to protect themselves during an earthquake can also save lives Many in Haiti did not know the safest places to go and some were killed in the aftershocks because they did not leave their buildings after the first quake struck For more on Haiti troubles see this AlertNet briefing on the country violent past Click here to

Four deadly storms battered Haiti in quick succession in 2008 in one of the worst disasters in its history Some 800 people were killed in the storms The World Bank says the disaster caused almost billion in damage in Haiti the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere where about half the population live on under a day The storms struck in a period of just four weeks causing fatal mudslides and widespread flooding Thousands of homes were destroyed or damaged and crops and livestock wiped out Tropical Storm Hanna unexpectedly smashed into the country in early September killing hundreds just days after Tropical Storm Gustav killed around 75 Days later Hurricane Ike killed at least 65 people Another storm Fay killed around 50 people in mid August The disasters affected nine out of ten regions of Haiti Hanna torrential rains submerged the port city of Gonaives under metres 6.5 feet of water affecting at least 80 percent of the 300,000 estimated to live in the town Food warehouses and hospitals were flooded in the city where many people only survived by scrambling onto rooftops When the floodwaters receded they left behind deep piles of mud human bodies and animal carcasses The aid operation was severely complicated by the fact that all roads and bridges into the town were destroyed or submerged meaning supplies had to be brought in by helicopter or boat Tens of thousands of people sought refuge in makeshift shelters where conditions were dire In many cases there was nothing but the roof overhead no food no water nothing to cook with no sleeping mats no latrines or toiletries and no medical supplies People sustained foot injuries from wading through water without shoes Others developed diarrhoea and skin diseases President Rene Preval called the situation catastrophic comparing it to the floods from Tropical Storm Jeanne in September 2004 that killed more than 3,000 people around Gonaives The port city which also bore the brunt of Tropical Storm Hanna faces the sea and is at points more than metre below sea level The storm flooded 95 percent of shops in the city according to the town police chief and many residents lost their means of making a living with stocks of small businesses ruined or washed away The misery wreaked by the storms came at a difficult time for Haiti coinciding with the installation of a new government to replace one dismissed in April 2008 amid violent protests over rising food prices Prospery Raymond country representative for Christian Aid said the whole of the Artibonite valley was flooded which is where 80 percent of rice is grown The United Nations launched a 108 million flash appeal later revised to 127.5 million The initial response was poor and still appeared to be only half funded by the beginning of 2009 The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies appealed separately for 3.4 million Haiti is extremely vulnerable to flash floods and mudslides because most of its hillsides have been stripped bare Cutting down trees to make charcoal to sell for fuel is a last resort for many rural Haitians who have no other income between harvests The country has known little but political upheaval and dictatorship since a slave revolt ended French rule more than 200 years ago AlertNet has a crisis briefing on Haiti FLOODING IN WIDER REGION The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November in the Caribbean posing a threat to coastal communities when tropical storms and hurricanes generate storm surges and trigger landslides and flash floods An average season has 10 tropical storms of which six strengthen into hurricanes Elsewhere in Latin America torrential rains between December and May can swamp agricultural land destroy livelihoods damage homes and services and force mass evacuations In early 2008 devastating floods hit Bolivia Ecuador and Peru as a weather abnormality known as La Nina brought some of the heaviest rains in a swelling rivers and bursting banks Ecuador and Peru both declared states of emergency Meaning little girl in Spanish La Nina is an unusual cooling of Pacific Ocean surface temperatures that can trigger more hurricanes and worse rains in many places In late 2008 serious flooding also affected Honduras and Colombia Death tolls from floods have generally fallen in recent years as countries become more adept at disaster prevention although experts warn that more people are likely to be affected in future as global warming generates more and bigger floods British researchers say they have shown that a Celsius temperature rise in the Atlantic Ocean can fuel a 40 percent increase in hurricanes Other factors increasing flood risks include deforestation and rapid urban growth 

Crippled economy Haiti which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere and most people in Haiti earn less than a day It is ranked 145th in the Development Programme 2010 Human Development Index Before the January 2010 quake donor policies on the economy focused on boosting Haiti textile industry and its export processing zones areas where foreign companies can set up factories free of taxes and government regulations on wages and working conditions The zones created thousands of jobs but some experts say workers are so poorly paid they have had limited impact on reducing poverty The government wants to improve the agriculture sector to boost food production and help create jobs for the tens of thousands who fled the devastated capital after the quake For many years Haiti has been heavily dependent on food imports partly because farmers moved to the cities in the hope of better wages in factories or were encouraged to shift away from subsistence farming to growing crops for export The lack of investment in rural areas worsened poverty in the countryside home to most of Haiti poorest says Yasmine Shamsie associate professor at Canada Wilfrid Laurier University and of the book Haiti Hope for a Fragile State There were also terrible consequences for the environment as desperate rural folk deforested the landscape says Shamsie This in turn has made the country more susceptible to deadly floods and mudslides in the wake of hurricanes Cutting down trees to make charcoal to sell for fuel is a last resort for many rural Haitians who have no other income between harvests 

Exile Aristide returned to power in 2001 However his election victory was not recognised by the main opposition parties who had boycotted the presidential poll accusing Aristide Lavalas party of fraud in earlier parliamentary polls that were criticised by international observers By 2003 the country was deeply divided between and camps Aristide once seen as a hero of democracy was accused of despotism and corruption and fled in 2004 in the midst of an armed revolt and under intense and French pressure Aristide accused the United States of kidnapping him after arriving in Central African Republic on a flight But Washington said he had resigned After his departure an interim government took over and the United Nations sent a peacekeeping force to prevent the country descending into civil war Those behind the subsequent bloodshed included criminal street gangs supporters and rebels former members of the army who played a key role in forcing Aristide out Gunfights and kidnappings prompted many aid groups to scale back their work in the capital most violent slum Cite Soleil which is home to between 300,000 and 600,000 people Cite Soleil and other shanty towns were the bedrock of Aristide Lavalas movement that first swept him to the presidency The interim government which blamed Aristide for fomenting violence from exile in South Africa took a hard line against Aristide supporters prompting an outcry from human rights groups Preval distanced himself from Aristide but did not rule out allowing him to return from exile The government threw down the gauntlet to the nation armed gangs in August 2006 telling them to lay down their weapons or be killed

Hurricane Ike ripped through the Caribbean in early September 2008 adding to the season storm death toll in Haiti and pounding Cuba twice Ike pushed up the death toll in Haiti by at least 70 on top of more than 600 killed in the weeks before by Tropical Storm Hanna and Hurricane Gustav AlertNet has a Haiti floods briefing The storm hit eastern and central Cuba on and then turned back to swipe the western side of the island two days later Cuba proud of its hurricane alert system and efficient evacuations evacuated more than 2.5 million people about 22 percent of the country 11.4 million population and escaped with a death toll you could count on the fingers of one hand The storm damaged at least 200,000 Cuban homes including 30,000 that were destroyed when it blasted across the Isle of Youth and westernmost province of Pinar del Rio which was still reeling after being hit by Hurricane Gustav on Aug 30 State media said the number of houses damaged by the two storms together was 320,000 Officials said Cuba already had a shortage of about 500,000 homes The storm partly or completely toppled at least 65 buildings in beautiful but crumbling Havana Ike had already battered the Dominican Republic and southern Bahamas and torn roofs off houses when it hit Britain Turks and Caicos Islands as a ferocious Category hurricane Big waves and storm surges were expected to subside the day after the storm hit Cuba east but heavy rains in the west continued causing widespread flooding and the threat of flash floods Ike also hit Texas on 13 killing at least 30 people and devastating the island city of Galveston before heading north Overall Ike cut power to more than 7.7 million homes and businesses in the United States as it cut a destructive path all the way to New York FOOD SHORTAGE WARNING In Cuba the government says Ike and Gustav have caused billion in damage the worst destruction in the island history A third of Cuba agriculture has been destroyed including nearly all its sugarcane Cuba has warned of impending food shortages and says it has adopted measures to speed up production and ensure fair distribution of available food These include salvaging as much food as possible from fallen crops and damaged warehouses dispersing dampened fertilizer before it becomes unusable and planting crops that mature quickly Cuba which imports a large percentage of its food was already struggling with soaring fuel and import prices before the storms hit Countries including Russia Spain Brazil Venezuela Ecuador Honduras and Colombia have sent goods and Cuba has accepted an offer of 3.5 million in aid from the United Nations But the government rejected offers of up to million in aid in protest at the trade embargo The United States later said it had given million through humanitarian agencies Washington refused Cuba request to temporarily lift its trade embargo in place for 46 years so that it could buy what it needed 

Hurricane Katrina hit America Gulf coast on 29 2005 killing more than 1,800 people driving 2.16 million from their homes and causing 75 billion of damage Winds of up to 130 mph 210 kph lashed Louisiana Mississippi Florida Georgia and Alabama affecting an area roughly the size of Britain Many of the same places were hit by another strong hurricane Rita on 24 2005 compounding the misery Katrina swelled the coastal waters with a storm surge of more than 20 feet metres flooding large areas of Biloxi and Gulfport Mississippi and causing terrible damage up and down the coast The surge put intolerable strain on flood defences surrounding New Orleans and more than 75 percent of the historic city was under six to 20 feet two to six metres of water within hours of the hurricane making landfall Tens of thousands of people who were unwilling or unable to leave the stricken city had to be rescued from their rooftops Authorities issued a mandatory evacuation as the storm approached but failed to provide transport for people without vehicles or the resources to leave Several days after the storm buses and planes finally took people out of the stricken city which had a population of about 485,000 before Katrina The evacuees were spread across the country and many of those flooded out of their homes have yet to return scattered in places like Houston and Dallas in the state of Texas and Atlanta in Georgia 

More than 1,800 people died after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf coast on 29 2005 Another 2.16 million people were evacuated from their homes and many have not yet returned The disaster hit the states of Louisiana Mississippi Florida Georgia and Alabama states affecting an area the size of Britain Many of the same places were hit by another strong hurricane Rita on 24 2005 In addition to Katrina fierce winds which reached around 130 mph 210 kph a storm surge of more than 20 feet metres swelled the coastal waters tearing oil rigs from the sea bed washing many of the area famous casino boats inshore flooding large areas of Biloxi and Gulfport Mississippi and causing terrible damage up and down the coast This surge put intolerable strain on the flood defences that surrounded New Orleans in Louisiana and more than 75 percent percent of the historic city was under to 20 feet to metres of water within hours of the hurricane making landfall In all some 215,000 homes were damaged in New Orleans which had a population of about 485,000 before Katrina In addition many of the area airports roads schools bridges warehouses and hospitals were damaged and temporarily closed after being hit by the hurricane The storm caused an estimated 75 billion of damage Ports in the area which once dealt with a quarter of imports and exports were closed for a time because of damage Oil production in the Gulf of Mexico fell by 95 percent as a result of Katrina President George Bush declared the states of Louisiana Mississippi Florida and Alabama major disaster areas and the Department of Homeland Security began to offer federal assistance to those affected But all levels of government soon came under fire from survivors analysts and the media who questioned the speed of the response and asked why so many of those left to face the storm were mostly poor and black The work of the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA came under the strongest attack and its director Michael Brown who had been criticised as resigned two weeks after the storm 

Rebuilding a city New Orleans is getting back on its dancing feet but the city has changed There a shortage of homes to rent and prices have rocketed This has made it hard for people who want to come back and rebuild their houses unless they perch trailers on their property While the tourist hotspots the mainstay of the city economy look like the storm never hit neighbourhoods are struggling to get people to return Evacuees were scattered in places like Houston and Dallas in Texas and Atlanta in the state of Georgia making it difficult to come back for visits or to rebuild homes Many were worried there would be any services in their community a justified concern since it took 14 months to get drinking water back to the Lower Ninth Ward one of the neighbourhoods Opening hours for shops have been cut and hospitals child care facilities and schools not back to normal with teachers in short supply School enrolment figures indicate that fewer families with children have returned New Orleans residents told researchers their top reason for hesitating in coming back was concern there would be enough police Many homeowners had problems with insurance claims and premiums have soared another obstacle to reconstruction There were heated debates in the storm aftermath about what kind of town to rebuild with some arguing it was an ideal time to do away with public housing developments that had become steeped in crime and others arguing against what they saw as the privatisation and gentrification of the city The demographics of the city changed with the black population reduced although white residents still make up less than half of the population Much of the intensive and reconstruction work was done by immigrant Latinos over 80 percent according to research published in American Anthropologist journal Many of the migrant workers reported being forced into long work days with little rest for low pay being crammed into small rooms for the duration of the job As a final insult some employers shopped undocumented migrants to the authorities for being illegal once they used their labour 

Why did New Orleans flood New Orleans was vulnerable to a hurricane such as Katrina because it lies below sea level on land east of the Mississippi River and south of Lake Pontchartrain In addition the relatively flat bottom of the Gulf of Mexico makes the area very vulnerable to the storm surges water pushed towards land by high winds that accompany hurricanes and tropical storms According to the National Hurricane Center the danger posed by storm surge is related to the angle of a coastline continental shelf If this is very long and shallow as with the Gulf of Mexico a hurricane can force water far into coastal communities Louisiana is especially vulnerable because of its lack of barrier islands or hills New Orleans relies on 350 miles 560 km of levees and other measures the majority of which were built by the Army Corps of Engineers However under the sustained pressure of the hurricane storm surge the levees broke in two places allowing water to pour into the city At the height of the storm Lake Pontchartrain which is normally just a foot above sea level peaked at 8.6 feet above sea level Analysts initially believed the flooding was caused by a combination of overtopping when flood waters go over the top of a levee and breaches where the fabric of the levee fails and allows water to flow though But a report by the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force a group of 150 engineers and experts from government academia and industry contradicted early theories about the levee failure It claimed the collapse of the 17th Street Canal floodwall which contributed to the flooding of much of central New Orleans was caused by a weakness in its construction The pressure of the Katrina floodwater had pushed the concrete floodwall back causing a tear in the area where the wall met the earthen levee on which it was built When the waters rushed into this tear the floodwall gave way This finding has worried analysts who point out that several miles of floodwalls that were damaged but not destroyed by Katrina are of similar construction 

A hurricane is a revolving tropical storm accompanied by torrential rain and wind speeds exceeding 119 kilometres 74 miles per hour In the Americas and the Caribbean these storms are called hurricanes In the western Pacific East Asia and Australia they are typhoons And in the Indian Ocean they are cyclones Storm strength varies from Category to the lowest referring to storms with winds of 119-153 kph 74-95 mph and Category to winds exceeding 249 kph 155 mph according to the Hurricane Scale The impact depends not just on wind speed but also on where a storm strikes how much flooding it causes and the quality of buildings and infrastructure in the affected area The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November posing a threat to coastal communities when tropical storms and hurricanes generate storm surges and trigger landslides and flash floods The Eastern Pacific hurricane season begins in and also ends on November 30 The eastern Pacific has experienced suppressed hurricane activity since 1995 while the Atlantic Basin has experienced greatly enhanced activity For more background AlertNet has a Hurricane and Cyclones topic briefing BUSY 2010 SEASON Leading forecasters at Colorado State University CSU have said the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season will be even more active than feared predicting 10 hurricanes five of them major with a 76 percent likelihood a major hurricane will hit the coastline The CSU team upped its forecast due to unusually warm tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures and the dissipation of the El Nino weather phenomenon over the Pacific Ocean These two factors reduce the probability of wind shear caused by a clash between prevailing winds out of the west and easterly winds out of Africa that can tear apart hurricanes or break up their circulation The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA has also forecast one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record and expects 14 to 23 named storms with eight to 14 becoming hurricanes nearly matching 2005 record of 15 Three to seven of these could be major hurricanes category or above If this outlook holds true this season could be one of the more active on record said Jane Lubchenco NOAA under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere The greater likelihood of storms brings an increased risk of a landfall In short we urge everyone to be prepared HAITI WORRIES There are fears about how a major hurricane sweeping through the Caribbean over Haiti would affect around 1.5 million homeless survivors of the 12 earthquake who are camping out under tents and tarpaulins They are seen as highly vulnerable to the tropical rains flooding and landslides that have killed thousands of Haitians in the past Since the quake aid agencies and the Haitian government have struggled to provide more robust shelter and relocate camps to safer land National Hurricane Center director Bill Read has said Haiti is his biggest concern this hurricane season warning of the potential for another catastrophe Flash floods have an especially deadly potential in the impoverished Caribbean nation because so much of it has been stripped of trees and other vegetation he said In 2004 Hurricane Jeanne killed over 3,000 Haitians while in 2008 hurricanes Fay Hanna Gustav and Ike killed some 1,000 people affected at least 800,000 destroyed 20,000 homes and wiped out 70 percent of crops The port city of Gonaives was left filled with sludge without food and clean water and cut off from supplies For more read AlertNet Haiti floods briefing The expected extreme hurricane season in 2010 also poses a threat to efforts to control and clean up oil spewing from a ruptured Gulf of Mexico well owned by BP Plc described by President Barack Obama administration as the worst environmental disaster in history Experts warn a storm surge in the Gulf of Mexico an abnormal rise in sea level created by a hurricane could whip the oil slick and chemicals used in trying to disperse it out of the Gulf and ashore on beaches vegetation and even homes PACIFIC STORM HITS CENTRAL AMERICA According to the NOAA outlook for 2010 there is a 75 percent chance of a hurricane season in the eastern Pacific with nine to 15 named storms and four to eight hurricanes of which one to three could be major hurricanes Nonetheless the season got off to a destructive start Agatha the first named storm of the season slammed into the Guatemalan coast near the border with Mexico on May 29 causing rivers to overflow washing away villages and damaging coffee plantations At least 180 people were killed in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador All three countries declared a state of emergency and international aid agencies swung into action to get relief supplies to the tens of thousands of people affected by the storm Parts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica also experienced heavy rains Giant sinkholes in Guatemala capital created death traps on streets having swallowed entire buildings as they opened up and blocking off major roads And the country health minister warned of outbreaks of dengue and malaria due to stagnant water Agatha hit during an eruption of Guatemala Pacaya volcano south of the capital which heightened the risk of flooding as ash blocked drains Central America is vulnerable to heavy rains because of its mountainous terrain and poor communications in rural areas that hamper rescue efforts Hurricane Ida killed at least 150 people as it pounded through the region in November 2009 BETTER PREPARED Since Hurricane Mitch which battered Central America in 1998 killing over 10,000 people aid agencies have increasingly focused on raising awareness among local communities about what to do in the event of a natural disaster and preparing them to cope better Early warning systems and programmes run by the Red Cross in Guatemala for example have included practising evacuation drills and planning evacuation routes identifying and mapping the areas and communities most at risk of flooding and training local community leaders in first aid In the 2008 hurricane season Cuba proud of its alert system and disaster planning evacuated more than 2.5 million people nearly a quarter of the population from the path of storms and escaped with a death toll you could count on the fingers of one hand But 320,000 homes were damaged adding to housing woes in a country which already had a shortage of about half a million homes For more read AlertNet Hurricane Ike briefing Also in that year authorities evacuated millions from the paths of Gustav and Ike

Iraq under Saddam Saddam had already been the country effective strongman for a decade when he came to power in 1979 He abolished Islamic law and turned Iraq into a secular state His government was drawn from the minority Sunni community marginalising the majority and Kurds The country is predominantly about 60 percent and Sunnis form about 20 percent of Iraqis The rest of the population is mostly made up of Kurds Smaller minorities include Turkmen and Assyrians Iraq and Iran went to war in 1980 relations having deteriorated after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran The conflict left up to million dead and Iraq heavily indebted The war helped Saddam justify the creation of a nuclear programme and the world fourth largest army Saddam used chemical weapons on Iranian troops and later against Iraqi civilians most notably in an attack on the town of Halabja in 1988 which killed 5,000 Kurds according to human rights activists Iraq repression of the Kurds and did not attract huge international attention at the time But the 1990 invasion of tiny Kuwait to the south was not overlooked A force expelled the Iraqis from the nation the following year The invasion triggered international sanctions The United States United Kingdom and France imposed zones over the Kurdish north in 1991 and the south in 1992 to protect the local populations France later pulled out of patrolling the zones In an attempt to minimise the impact of sanctions on ordinary Iraqis the United Nations administered an programme from 1996 onwards which allowed the regime to sell oil in return for humanitarian goods However some humanitarian agencies and academics say the sanctions led to the deaths of tens of thousands of children The trade embargo made it hard for Iraq to rebuild civilian infrastructure which had been destroyed during the Gulf War Almost all the country electricity plants were bombed and sanitation systems failed and untreated sewage flowed into rivers used for drinking water rapidly spreading disease The Iraqi government lack of cooperation with the United States and United Nations were partly to blame for the duration of the sanctions and its actions made their impact worse Iraq periodically halted oil sales to protest the sanctions Child mortality rates rose in the south and centre where Saddam was in charge but they fell in northern Iraq where the managed the relief programme Towards the end of the 1990s the sanctions were eased and Iraq was allowed to sell more oil and import the goods necessary to restore infrastructure and agriculture This provided some relief but also appears to have enriched Saddam and those around him An independent inquiry after the invasion found thousands of companies had colluded with Saddam government to skim 1.8 billion off the programme

The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November in the Caribbean posing a threat to coastal communities when tropical storms and hurricanes generate storm surges and trigger landslides and flash floods An average season has 10 tropical storms of which six strengthen into hurricanes Elsewhere in Latin America torrential rains between December and May can swamp agricultural land destroy livelihoods damage homes and services and force mass evacuations In 2009 floods and mudslides in northeastern Brazil killed around 40 people left hundreds of thousands homeless and devastated swathes of farmland The flooding said to be the worst in recent memory has washed out bridges and roads submerged homes and destroyed crops according to aid workers Aid agencies say there are fears of food shortages and growing risks of outbreaks of diseases and insect infestations In early 2008 devastating floods hit Bolivia Ecuador and Peru as a weather abnormality known as La Nina brought some of the heaviest rains in a swelling rivers and bursting banks Ecuador and Peru both declared states of emergency Meaning little girl in Spanish La Nina is an unusual cooling of Pacific Ocean surface temperatures that can trigger more hurricanes and worse rains in many places In late 2008 serious flooding also affected Honduras and Colombia Death tolls from floods have generally fallen in recent years as countries become more adept at disaster prevention although experts warn that more people are likely to be affected in future as global warming generates more and bigger floods British researchers say they have shown that a Celsius temperature rise in the Atlantic Ocean can fuel a 40 percent increase in hurricanes Other factors increasing flood risks include deforestation and rapid urban growth 

DEC publishes evaluation of early Pakistan floods aid effort The DEC has today Monday 27 June published an independent assessment of the aid efforts of its member agencies during the first four months after the 2010 Pakistan Floods The report found that DEC agencies built on their existing presence and partnerships in north west Pakistan to rapidly reach survivors and successfully focused on the most immediate needs of the most vulnerable groups of displaced people Pakistan Floods 2010 The DEC Evaluation Report was produced by the ThinkAhead international development consultancy This type of evaluation is primarily designed as a tool to help DEC member agencies learn from each others experiences during the first phase of a disaster response The DEC today also revealed for the first time that its Pakistan Floods Appeal raised a final total of 71m the third highest total ever raised by the DEC after the appeals for the 2004 tsunami and 2010 Haiti earthquake The DEC itself raised 41m and member agencies raised 30m towards the appeal Member agencies spent 17m of the 41m collected by the DEC in the first six months after the disaster to help 1.8 million people The assistance provided included Emergency shelter for 290,000 people Clean water for 510,000 people Safe toilets for 160,000 people Medical consultations for 37,000 patients Help to restart farming for 26,000 people The monsoon rains which began to hit Pakistan in late July 2010 were the most severe in the countrys 80 year history They caused immediate flash flooding in the mountains of the north west of the country and ultimately flood waters worked their way south through the Indus and other river systems to engulf an area the size of the UK Although the UK public and government have been generous in their support of those affected by the floods the report noted that the most serious risks in the early aid effort arose from the mismatch between the massive scale of the disaster and the relatively paucity of global funding available in the early stages of the response This early funding gap contributed to delays of several weeks in DEC members extending a large scale response from the north west of the country into the more southerly provinces of Punjab Balochistan and Sindh which were also badly affected as the flood waters spread down the river Indus The report also found that DEC agencies initially struggled to meet the most urgent needs of the worst affected survivors as they began returning in vast numbers from temporary camps to their ruined villages within weeks of being displaced DEC Chief Executive Brendan Gormley said All disasters are a tragedy for those caught up in them but the Pakistan floods were exceptional because of the vast number of people affected The response to our appeal was extremely generous and the UK public can be proud that the massive aid effort they helped fund has already provided support to 1.8 million people Our real time evaluations are part of our commitment to learn from everything we do They focus not on our achievements but on what we could do better even in the challenging circumstances we face in places such as Pakistan The DEC and its members are committed to publishing these reviews because we believe in sharing what we learn and in being open with and accountable to both disaster affected communities and donors The new website that we will shortly launch and our forthcoming 2010-11 annual report will help us make details of how we spend donor money not just more available but also more accessible Up to 21 million people were affected by the Pakistan Floods with 12 million seeing their homes damaged or completely destroyed The vast scale of the tragedy means that many people still need very substantial help to rebuild their lives The reports authors noted these numbers exceeded the combined total of individuals affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake 

Over the course of the 2010 monsoon season Pakistan experienced the worst floods in its history Heavy rainfall flash floods and riverine floods combined to create a moving body of water equal in dimension to the land mass of the United Kingdom The floods have affected 78 districts out of a total of 141 districts in Pakistan and more than 18 million people of Pakistans population devastating villages from the Himalayas to the Arabian Sea More than 1,700 people have lost their lives and at least 1.7 million homes have been damaged or destroyed As of the publication of this revision seven weeks since heavy rainfall and flash floods claimed their first victims flood waves continue to devastate the southern province of Sindh where the full extent of losses and damages may not be known for several more weeks The Pakistan Initial Floods Emergency Response Plan PIFERP was launched on 11 August seeking an initial 459 million to respond to the immediate relief needs of people This revised Response Plan which takes into account fresh needs assessments fluctuating beneficiary figures and an extended planning and budgeting horizon seeks 1.9 billion to enable international partners UN organizations and NGOs to support the Government of Pakistan in addressing the residual relief needs and early recovery needs of floodaffected families for the next twelve months A midterm revision will be carried out in the first quarter of 2011 to provide more refined data and analysis on early recovery needs The overarching goal of this plan is to prevent excess morbidity and mortality and to enable floodaffected communities to return to their normal lives The consequent strategic objectives are 

The storm destroyed villages and paddy fields seriously affecting up to 2.4 million people in Yangon and the Irrawaddy Delta Two years on aid workers say around 800,000 survivors are still living in makeshift shelters The shelters cobbled together from tarpaulin and bamboo poles give them little protection from the elements especially during the annual monsoon season And tens of thousands of people lack drinking water especially during the dry season which lasts from November to May Ponds and wells were heavily salinated after flooded the region during the cyclone About 1,000 km of coastal embankments which protect the region from floods need repairing Some aid agencies say another major storm will destroy the homes and infrastructure that have been rebuilt Aid levels have dropped too low to enable cyclone survivors to recover their way of life Many farmers are struggling with crippling debts after the cyclone destroyed their crops and most of the region livestock Rice yields are down by about 40 percent compared with levels partly because flood embankments damaged by the cyclone no longer protect rice fields from sea water at high tide the Food and Agriculture Organisation in Myanmar says Farmers who have been unable to borrow enough money have begun selling their land and now make a living as casual labourers This has reduced job opportunities for people who were labourers before the cyclone struck Fishing communities too are struggling to recover The main aid coordinating body the Tripartite Core Group TCG has not yet been able to raise enough funds for its recovery plan A global economic crisis is squeezing foreign donor governments and Myanmar already receives far less aid than other poor countries because of its dismal human rights record A assessment by the TCG has estimated the damage at billion It says some 42 percent of food stocks were destroyed The TCG comprises the United Nations Myanmar and its Southeast Asian neighbours The United Nations World Food Programme WFP stopped distributing food aid in the delta region in December 2009 saying it was no longer needed JUNTA RESTRICTIONS Most of those who died were killed by a 3.5 metre 12-foot wall of water that hit the Irrawaddy Delta along with 240 kph 150 mph winds The dead included 10,000 who perished in just one town Bogalay 90 km southwest of Yangon The cyclone was the worst to hit Asia since 1991 when 143,000 people died in Bangladesh But the country ruling generals who have a deep mistrust of the outside world were initially reluctant to let foreign aid workers into the country sparking strong international criticism After three weeks Myanmar junta finally agreed to admit international aid workers albeit under tight restrictions The government accepted relief flights into Yangon but rejected offers of French and American ships delivering aid The military regime also let WFP airlift supplies into the delta and allowed in medical teams from Southeast Asian neighbours Before his breakthrough deal with the junta chief Ban said aid workers had only been able to reach around a quarter of those in need Aid workers say much has been achieved since but it will take years of sustained international support for the worst hit areas to fully recover Some had expressed initial optimism that their work in the cyclone area could lead to more humanitarian access elsewhere in the country But the generals have dashed any hope of that arresting activists who led private cyclone relief efforts and tightening their grip ahead of scheduled 2010 elections The Myanmar regime says it is ending the TCG mandate in July 2010 and it is unclear how this will affect foreign agencies operating in the delta The TCG says its planned recovery programmes will continue until the end of December 2011 MONKS DELIVER AID Following the cyclone survivors crammed into monasteries schools and other buildings after arriving in towns that were on the breadline even before the disaster The homeless clamoured to get into privately run shelters rather than camps In Bogalay some complained of forced labour and low supplies of food at the centres Frustrated by the speed of the official response ordinary people sent trucks and vans into the delta with clothes biscuits dried noodles and rice provided by private companies and individuals With almost total distrust of the government private aid was left for distribution by Buddhist monks who have immense moral authority Officials said legal action would be taken against anybody found hoarding or selling relief supplies amid rumours of local military units expropriating trucks of food blankets and water Some weeks into the aid operation the United Nations revealed it had suffered significant losses because of distorted official exchange rates The government later agreed to let outside donors pay local companies directly and in dollars rather than via the official system involving foreign exchange certificates SHELTER Nargis destroyed 375,000 homes according to government estimates The United Nations puts the figure higher at 450,000 Only a small proportion of these have been rebuilt while the majority have been repaired by their owners But many of these homes are fragile Normally natural materials such as thatch from palm trees and shrubs are used to make cheap relatively rainproof roofing but Nargis destroyed trees along with buildings Nearly all Nargis survivors received some form of emergency shelter after the storm including those few allowed into the junta model villages after the generals were criticised for their slow response to the disaster But donors have been consistently reluctant to fund shelter Although they give money for education health care and food donors consider housing and infrastructure to be the government responsibility AGRICULTURE AND DEBT The Irrawaddy Delta an area covering some 23,500 sq km is known as the country rice bowl Across the cyclone zone families are seeing mounting debts and shrinking crops Output has fallen due to soil salinity lost livestock a lack of credit and outbreaks of pests damaging paddy fields Meanwhile prices for rice and other commodities have plunged along with the global economy Add to that the rising cost of inputs like fertiliser and many farmers say growing rice is no longer commercially viable REFERENDUM Despite the cyclone the junta went ahead with a referendum on May 10 2008 on a new constitution part of the army roadmap to democracy and said 92 percent voted in favour The opposition and Western governments said it was a blueprint for the generals to cement their grip on power Myanmar has been ruled by a military junta since 1962 The referendum was postponed by a fortnight in areas hit by the cyclone Western governments led by the United States and Britain have also criticised the planned 2010 poll as a sham aimed at entrenching rule by the military which refused to recognise the last election won in 1990 by Aung San Suu Kyi National League for Democracy For more background on the country see Myanmar troubles

Hidden displacement One of the most serious and largely hidden consequences of Nigeria ongoing violence is the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people from their homes In a 2007 report the National Commission for Refugees put the total of internally displaced persons IDPs at more than 1.2 million However the true number of IDPs in Nigeria is disputed The IDMC declines to give an estimate describing the issue of numbers of IDPs as very problematic The main reason is the absence of a registration system and thus a lack of data In April 2006 a presidential advisor on migration and humanitarian affairs said estimates for the number of IDPs in the country varied from 500,000 to millions The picture is further confused by complex patterns of movement Many displaced Nigerians seek refuge with their families friends or communities of the same ethnic group Once violence has subsided some go home or resettle nearby but others head to different areas making it hard to distinguish between those fleeing violence and economic migrants The Nigerian Red Cross Society is widely regarded as the country most efficient humanitarian body and is often able to respond to a displacement crisis more quickly than local or governments which lack capacity and resources IDMC says Federal bodies like the National Commission for Refugees and the National Emergency Management Agency may be called in to help organisations also play an important role in helping the displaced The United Nations focuses on development issues partly to try and address some of the root causes of recurrent conflicts rather than humanitarian issues

Delivering aid in a secretive state The world has committed billions of dollars in food aid but comprehensive aid programmes have been hampered by government obstruction and international fears over North Korea nuclear ambitions A critical issue is the restrictions the North places on aid workers ability to check where the food ends up WFP donors say monitoring is vital to ensure that aid is not diverted to the military or the ruling party which has been accused of appalling human rights abuses WFP has a principle of no food and international staff monitor distribution But aid workers have to obtain official permission to access areas and are often obliged to use local interpreters However WFP was allowed to use interpreters of any nationality in its emergency operation launched in April 2011 North Korea has also relied heavily on bilateral aid from China and South Korea which do not insist on monitoring But the South turned off the tap in 2008 with a new government saying its future generosity would depend on Pyongyang progress in abiding by an international nuclear pact and other political issues In 2008 the United States pledged to give 500,000 tonnes of food aid to North Korea its first bilateral assistance in eight years The bulk of it was to be distributed through the WFP and 100,000 tonnes of food through five organisations NGOs Distribution began in July after North Korea agreed to relax restrictions on aid agencies ability to monitor deliveries in an unprecedented deal But this was stalled by the North Korean government in 2009 and the NGOs distributing the food were thrown out of the country In 2010 former Special Rapporteur Muntarbhorn said this may have been because the government rejected closer international monitoring of aid procedures and because of fears the aid groups might start using interpreters from outside the country Pyongyang has since reached out to dozens of countries and organisations around the world for aid complaining that bad weather rising global food prices and the termination of aid had slashed supplies It stepped up its appeals in 2011 In March 2011 the United Nations estimated that million people needed food aid In May South Korea said it suspected Pyongyang of exaggerating the food crisis and of trying to hoard food ahead of a nuclear test which would likely provoke a tightening of international sanctions Some South Korean officials also said the North might be trying to stockpile food to give away as part of the 2012 celebrations to mark the centenary of the birth of the state founder Kim In July the European Commission said it was convinced that the North pleas for help were genuine and announced an aid package aimed at severely malnourished children under five years old who had already been hospitalised 

The road to famine In the 1990s North Korea suffered one of the most destructive famines of the 20th century No one knows how many people died although analysts say it killed at least million people and between and percent of the population Since then the country has been heavily reliant on international food aid So how did the country end up in this mess Pyongyang points the finger at a series of natural catastrophes but this is not the whole story After World War Two the Korean peninsula split in two The Republic of Korea proclaimed sovereignty in the South and the Democratic People Republic of Korea DPRK did the same in the North The North invaded the South in 1950 hoping to unify the peninsula The conflict ended with an armistice in 1953 Since then South Korea has grown into one of Asia most affluent countries while the North has slid into poverty Before the split the southern part of the Korean peninsula was the traditional rice basket for the whole country After the split the Communist north collectivised agriculture and set up a public distribution system to distribute food according to age occupation region and political loyalty This was an important means of political control and the main source of food for most North Koreans until the system broke down during the famine in the The man who shaped North Korea was its founding father and eternal president Kim who introduced a philosophy of juche or But this strategy has caused major problems given that only a fifth of the land is arable and the climate is less than favourable Despite its commitment to North Korea actually relied heavily on its socialist allies for products including fertiliser and insecticides With the collapse of the Soviet Union it found itself in dire straits Although China continued to supply petroleum and food this was no match for the help once received from the Soviet Union And China itself was changing and increasingly wanted hard currency for its exports As outside assistance fell so did government rations via the public distribution system and the annual farm workers grain allowance In 1991 the government initiated a Let eat two meals a day campaign Kim died in 1994 and was succeeded by his son Kim referred to as Dear Leader in state media The succession marked the only time in history that rule of a communist state has passed from a father to a son Death rates in North Korea were rising by 1994 if not earlier and by the spring of 1995 the situation had grown desperate enough for Pyongyang to ask Japan and South Korea for emergency assistance But things were about to get worse In the summer of 1995 the country was hit by floods The effects were exacerbated by soil erosion and river silting caused by previous deforestation that was the result of North Korea efforts to increase cultivation There were more floods in 1996 But as aid began arriving in North Korea the country took the curious step of reducing its commercial imports diverting the money it saved to other priorities including the military according to the Hunger and Human Rights in North Korea report by the Committee for Human Rights In 1999 at the same time as North Korea was cutting grain imports it spent scarce foreign exchange on 40 fighters and eight military helicopters from Kazakhstan the report authors say Times would have been tough under almost any policy but a famine killing 3-5 percent of the population was not they add

Pakistan 2010 floods were the countrys worst in recorded history They killed more than 2,000 people and affected 18 million more than a tenth of the population A massive cascade of waters triggered by heavy monsoon rains in late July swept through the Indus River basin washing away homes roads bridges crops and livestock It ploughed a swathe of destruction from north to south and submerged of the country The flooding devastated parts of northwest province which saw some of the fiercest fighting in Pakistan war against Taliban insurgents People in the Swat Valley who had been trying to rebuild their lives following a massive military operation against the Taliban in 2009 were particularly badly affected The southern Punjab and Sindh provinces where the majority of Pakistanis live were also badly affected An estimated 11 million people were made homeless by the disaster The floods destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of cultivatable land and crops in the traditional regions of Sindh and Punjab and many farmers lost their seeds In some areas the water stagnated on the surface for months making planting difficult And at least 1.2 million livestock died crippling poor families who depended on them for food and draught power the Food and Agriculture Organisation said The price of vegetables and other foods rose making it harder for ordinary people to survive The country suffered more than 10 billion in damages to infrastructure irrigation systems bridges houses and roads SLOW AID The authorities and aid agencies struggled to help the survivors many of whom lost everything and said they received no warnings that raging waters were heading their way Many were forced to live in wretched conditions beside roads sleeping in the open with little food or clean water Fears of a second wave of deaths caused by and diseases such as cholera typhoid and malaria eased as the floodwaters receded Aid organisations and the government were criticised for being too slow to respond while the military the most powerful institution in Pakistan took the lead in relief operations With the government overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster charities linked to Islamist militants were quick to step in with help Pakistan promised to clamp down on these charities amid fears their involvement in flood relief would undermine the fight against groups like the Taliban The United Nations issued an appeal for 460 million in August Speaking at a special meeting on 19 Ban called the crisis one of the greatest tests of global solidarity in our times Major donors included the United States which gives billions of dollars in military aid to help Islamabad fight Taliban and al Qaeda fighters along the Afghan border Britain and the European Union However donors concerns about the countrys widespread corruption and lack of transparency slowed disbursal of funds 2011 FLOODS Pakistan was woefully unprepared for the 2011 monsoon season All along the Indus River dikes and embankments are incomplete while international donations for preparedness fell short Sindh is especially vulnerable to new flooding Although a repeat of the 2010 deluge is unlikely even smaller floods could cause millions of dollars in damages and set back reconstruction efforts experts said The head of the emergencies office OCHA in Pakistan Manuel Bessler warned in June 2011 that floods are likely to affect million people although that figure could rise to million if the monsoons are heavier than expected The United Nations said it has been working hard to stockpile food water and tents in case of more floods this year Pakistans monsoon season lasts until the first week of September

province formerly known as the North West Frontier Province was formed in 1901 under British India and divided into Settled Areas and Tribal areas It has a population history and culture Armed conflict between government troops and militants has caused massive displacement especially in Swat Buner and Lower Dir districts The Swat Valley once a major tourist attraction became the scene of some of the worst fighting in Pakistan when the army launched a offensive in April 2009 Nearly two million civilians were displaced and hundreds of thousands more were trapped by the fighting and out of reach of external help People began slowly returning home in July after the Pakistan Army said it had cleared the Taliban out of Swat In the 1990s cleric Sufi Mohammad took up arms to impose sharia law in the Malakand region which includes Swat district He led thousands of fighters to Afghanistan in 2001 to help the Taliban resist the invasion and was arrested on his return to Pakistan Pakistani authorities released him in 2008 in a bid to defuse another uprising led by his Fazlullah who has ties with other Pakistani Taliban factions and al Qaeda Fazlullah called his men to arms after a military assault on the Red Mosque in Islamabad in The mosque had been taken over by extremists who were stockpiling weapons there in a bid to impose Islamic law The army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control A civilian government came to power in 2008 and tried to reach a negotiated settlement but a peace deal failed in May 2008 and fighting escalated The militants gained control of almost the entire valley and unleashed a reign of terror killing and beheading politicians entertainers soldiers and opponents They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls schools But the military has also been accused by local people of deliberately targeting civilians perceived to be sympathetic to the Taliban a charge vehemently denied by the military For more on this read Civilians suffer as Pakistan army targets Taliban In February 2009 Pakistan authorities agreed to introduce Islamic law in Malakand region dismantle all security checkpoints and release captured militants in return for peace The decision was strongly condemned by the United States which had made continued flows of aid conditional on Pakistan containing the Taliban groups The militants announced a ceasefire but refused to give up their arms and soon pushed into Buner district also part of Malakand and only 100 km 60 miles from Islamabad Amid mounting concern at home and abroad security forces launched an offensive in April 2009 to expel the militants Afghan Taliban leaders are believed to use Peshawar capital of as a base despite the heavy presence of Pakistan military and intelligence forces Millions of refugees who fled Afghanistan following the Soviet invasion in 1979 settled in Many have since returned home 

Displacement In both northwest and southwest Pakistan hundreds of thousands of citizens have fled violence Calculating the numbers is difficult because of a lack of access There are no government offices dedicated to the displacement issue and no national policies in place although ministries with health or children portfolios have responded to the crisis in some areas The government has prevented aid from reaching those displaced in Baluchistan and insurgent attacks on aid workers in many areas have also made it very difficult for agencies to reach them says the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre International aid agencies are trying to boost their development activities The tribal areas in particular have suffered from poor literacy scarce development funding and the fallout from the instability in Afghanistan Severe floods in 2010 hit hardest those areas where the displaced sought protection said the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre The floods affected not only those living in displacement camps but also the many families sheltering those who had fled conflict For more see AlertNet Pakistan floods briefing Pakistan hosts the largest refugee population in the world nearly 1.8 million Afghans the majority living in urban areas Another 3.5 million Afghans have returned home since March 2002 says the refugee agency UNHCR A surge of violence in Swat Buner and Lower Dir districts in 2009 forced nearly million to flee their homes Some sought shelter in the region displacement camps which are crowded and offer limited access to clean water and food But aid workers say the majority of displaced are reluctant to live in formal camps for cultural reasons as they feel their dignity is compromised and women can not strictly observe where they should be separated from men As a result many lived in cramped conditions with host communities or relatives Men often stayed behind to protect homes and livestock although this left women and children vulnerable to increased sexual violence and exploitation Thousands have slowly begun to return to their homes in Swat after the government said in July 2009 the area was safe Many people were also displaced when a massive earthquake hit and Kashmir in 2005 killing 75,000 people and leaving up to 3.5 million homeless has also been a refuge for millions fleeing fighting in other parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan FEDERALLY ADMINISTERD TRIBAL AREAS The United Nations estimated in September 2008 that 200,000 displaced people in the tribal areas FATA were beyond the reach of agencies The UNHCR reported in October 2008 that some 190,000 people had been displaced from FATA Bajaur area by fighting which began in August Most sought shelter in where the former Afghan refugee villages of Katcha Gari and Jalozai in or near Peshawar were adapted to cater for some of the displaced Some fled into eastern Afghanistan The UNHCR said it could not access most of these areas for security reasons and relied on government estimates Tens of thousands fled South Waziristan from May 2009 when troops began massing in the region ahead of a major military offensive which began in October 2009 The majority fled to staying with host families or in rented accommodation BALUCHISTAN Baluchistan displacement dates back to 2005 when the government launched a military offensive against separatists The number of displaced hovers at about 50-60,000 people They are living without clean drinking water or health care and dozens of children have died from malnutrition and disease The government has prevented aid from reaching the displaced in Baluchistan Aid agencies in Baluchistan include the UNHCR which mainly supports Afghan refugees in the province and the World Food Programme But humanitarian and development workers have come up against bureaucratic hurdles when trying to help the local population In June and July 2007 Baluchistan along with Sindh province was hit by severe flooding that destroyed homes crops and roads and temporarily displaced over 2.5 million people There was criticism of the humanitarian response to this disaster with aid agencies saying their ability to provide relief was hampered by the government hesitation in requesting international help

This past Ramadan was a very busy time for Life for Relief and Development Life staff volunteers and partners were working hard to provide food to needy families widows and orphans across the globe In Afghanistan staff members from Lifes regional office in Kabul were successful in distributing food baskets to some 220 needy families These food baskets were expected to provide each family with several weeks worth of food Life staff also succeeded in distributing food baskets to 170 families inside neighboring Pakistan It has only been one year since record floods left over 20 of Pakistan under water Those survivors who lost their homes farms and personal belongings continue to recover from the abhorrent poverty that has been thrust upon them Upon receiving their surprise gifts of food they lifted their hands to the heavens to thank Allah and to pray for those donations made the gifts possible This years Ramadan campaign was a continuation of Lifes annual commitment to deliver food to the needy during the holy month Millions of people have benefited from the charity given by Lifes donors over the past 18 years With Allahs help millions more people will receive assistance in the future 

Needs for increased support and funding dedicated to the recovery of livelihoods Massive efforts have been undertaken by the humanitarian community since the flooding began in July last year which left 1.9 million homes damaged and approximately USD 5.1 billion worth of agriculture inputs destroyed Donors international NGOs local organizations and authorities as well as concerned individuals across the world have worked together to implement and fund essential life saving projects in the relief stage According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs USD billion had been committed by international governments and agencies at the end of the emergency stage in January 2011 This emergency support was essential for immediate relief efforts such as providing food emergency shelters and clean water Pakistan now needs sustainable solutions to help people and communities rebuild their lives and increase their resilience to future potential disasters The recovery phase is now the priority to prevent additional deaths and disease and to enable people to return to their normal lives including a growing emphasis on sustainable shelter solutions livelihoods and community restoration ACTEDs commitment to early recovery Thus far in the early recovery phase ACTEDs priorities have been to provide continued assistance to Pakistans most vulnerable households to those affected by flooding and also to those affected by conflict ACTEDs early recovery flood strategy focuses on sustainability through support to economic development water and sanitation and community infrastructure rehabilitation and housing that takes into account disaster risk reduction Economic development is being targeted through a major focus on the agricultural sector by restoring and support to small farmers and support to small businesses ACTED is also focusing on value chains and market linkages Water and sanitation remain a priority in all three provinces with the ongoing rehabilitation of water supplies and a growing emphasis on community led total sanitation which involves strong beneficiary participation ACTED also strives to mainstream disaster risk reduction and disaster preparedness in all its infrastructure and shelter projects and is exploring innovative and environmentally friendly processes Food security and agricultural recovery as todays priority There is still much work to be done for affected communities in Pakistan to reach their levels and to help them sustain growth in the country One of the key sectors of focus for future funding must be agriculture where losses in livelihoods and fishery sectors amount to an estimated USD billion The assessment is clear flood damage had a horrendous impact on the livelihoods of small farmers across the country but the recovery period represents an opportunity for donors to invest in agricultural support programs that can integrate improved methods which will increase yield productivity and benefits for the poor farmers in Pakistan The reconstruction and rehabilitation phase across the different sectors in Pakistan will require support for 3-5 years and the total amount required for recovery and reconstruction could be as much as USD 10.85 billion But huge funding gaps exist and hinder adequate support in the early recovery period It is estimated that the total financial gap is USD 603 million with the largest proportion of the gap existing in housing agriculture and food security as well as water and sanitation 

By Bushra Khaliq One year ago during the months of July and August the floodwaters that ravaged the southern parts of Pakistan have long receded Though gone are the makeshift tent camps on roadsides but revival of normal life and livelihood still remain a challenge Thousands continue a daily struggle to support their families and livelihoods As a new monsoon season is in full swing last year trauma and economic pain still linger While last year victims struggle to recover others now worry that changing world weather patterns will cause renewed flooding The devastation caused by the 2010 floods was the worst in Pakistan history almost 2,000 deaths nearly 20 million displaced or affected and of the country went under water The deluge inflicted unprecedented catastrophic damage on a country already reeling from the effects of war on terrorism A year later the picture is dismal Although many flood refugees have returned homes little is known to the world about their miserable conditions and stories of struggle to combat the horrific effects on lives and livelihoods Particularly the women who are the still face multiple challenges after one year Their work burden is multiplied While husbands and male members in poor families being daily wagers are struggling to find sources of livelihood women remain busy in rebuilding their damaged shelters and dwellings In small villages and hamlets one can find these women doing brick work and plastering their mud and half cemented houses The brave ones who have done the reconstruction work are out in the fields to assist their husbands Rest or respite seems rare thing to them Their lost possessions have been replaced at higher costs or not at all Many marriageable girls who lost their dowries and valuables are making a fresh start to make it again to get marry To address the issue a new culture of collective marriages is gaining ground which was earlier unknown to these areas Unfortunately the phenomenon is giving rise to another social trend of early girl marriages Though the custom of girls early marriages is already present in Pakistan however the post flood conditions have given new impetus to this trend It must be stopped and the only way to tackle it is to initiate women focused programs in the area For instance any scheme to allocate state land and distribution of livestock among poor women in area will be helpful in addressing the issue Another particular problem is women health which is generally ignored Although during the floods pregnant women had the opportunity to avail themselves facilities of and post natal care provided through emergency medical camps but the moment the relief phase was over these women were left in conditions much vulnerable to diseases Moreover women and children are also facing nutritional problems on account of of proper healthy diet Those who lost their livestock are in fact deprived of milk and a permanent source of livelihood The compensation money from the government has been unevenly distributed Widows and families faced discrimination in distribution of Watan cards relief money and rehabilitation programs Despite tall claims the Government has failed to decrease the rising vulnerability level of poverty among women after one year While donors promises of some 600 million in aid have not arrived As a result squeezing livelihood options coupled with price hikes are impacting the poor families and women in worst manner Last month when I revisited Dera Shahwala a small village of district Muzaffargarh one of the areas in southern Punjab things were not much changed since my first visit soon after floods Though work on roads embankments and water is evident but the issues of provision and restoration of livelihood resources are yet to be resolved One of the main sources of livelihood for poor landless women in this area is cotton picking With loss of the crop they could not find an alternative In some cases where land is permanently overtaken by the rough sand there will be no crop at all making peasants resource less on and depriving women cotton pickers of their livelihood on the other hand A flood affectee here Myriam Bibi recalled that flood water washed away everything in the house and she lost most of what was inside and now lives in a newly erected small room while her children were sent away to stay with relatives She is rebuilding her house brick by brick with the help of her husband who contributed his free time after his day labor The work is progressing slowly and for the most part the house remains a roofless ruin Relatives and friends help us but not everyone is so lucky It is very difficult to rebuild our life she said I dont see in the coming years that I will have my house completely rebuilt Aysha Bibi a young mother of five and wife of a farm worker said floods however were profoundly discriminatory where they hit they impact different people with different degrees of misery Some people were more affected than others We lost our dwelling and the only cow now we can not purchase a new one I can not provide milk to my children Whatever money we had is spent on reconstruction of our home Another resident Zohra Begum said her 7-member family moved in the immediate aftermath We have a small piece of land where me and my 16-year daughter have to work longer hours to assist my tilling husband We owe debt to our relatives and we have to repay it My two children who used to go school are now supposed to be at home to look after the siblings When we first got here there were facilities for us But they have since been taken away Now people just come and talk and talk but they do not give us any help False rumors of massive floods are also leaving residents on edge People have sleepless nights in some areas near Indus It is a mental torture when we are hearing that there might be another monsoon flood said 36-year-old Parveen who is still struggling to rebuild her damaged home About the Author Bushra Khaliq is a writer from Pakistan She has been partnering with the Women International Shared Experience project in Pakistan and

2001 and beyond At the end of 2001 members of the opposition and international organisations gathered in Germany and drew up the Bonn Agreement which provided a political road map for Afghanistan and a timetable for reconstruction Hamid Karzai a Pashtun born to the Popalzai clan a minor of the royal Durrani tribe was chosen to head an Interim Authority He was later installed as president and won an outright majority in the first presidential election in 2004 Parliamentary elections were held the following year He was in 2009 after his main challenger Abdullah Abdullah pulled out saying a planned runoff vote was not going to be free and fair But the government authority remains fragile and violence has soared to the worst levels since the fall of the Taliban Militants have crossed the border from Pakistan to join the ranks of the Taliban fighters who are staging increasingly sophisticated attacks including multiple roadside bombings and complex ambushes Taliban numbers swelled from 7,000 in 2006 to roughly 25,000 in 2009 according to an October 2009 intelligence assessment President Barack Obama decided to send additional troops to Afghanistan in 2009 boosting the total number of foreign troops to about 150,000 Most of the new troops headed to the south the heart of the Taliban insurgency where British Canadian and Dutch soldiers did not have enough strength to keep hold of ground they captured Foreign troops numbered 130,000 in March 2011 most of them operating under the International Security Assistance Force with soldiers from more than 45 NATO and countries Several thousand troops and coalition forces serve on the border with Pakistan under the United States Operation Enduring Freedom In November 2010 NATO leaders agreed to begin transferring security responsibility in some areas to Afghans from 2011 and hand over control of the whole country by the end of 2014 allowing foreign combat troops to withdraw Foreign troops work with the Afghan National Army which was about 150,000 strong in February 2011 and is due to increase to 170,000 by October 2011 The Afghan police force numbered 118,000 in March 2011 and is due to grow to 134,000 by October 2011 As the violence has soared civilians have been dying in increasing numbers and the proportion killed by the Taliban has grown The civilian death toll rose 20 percent to 6,215 in the first 10 months of 2010 compared with 2009 according to the United Nations with insurgents responsible for more than of those killed or wounded In 2008 over half of civilians who died were killed by Taliban insurgents and their allies while a quarter died as a result of air strikes by and forces The high number of civilian casualties angered Karzai and weakened public support for the continued presence of foreign troops The Taliban insurgency has forced many schools and clinics to close and aid agencies to restrict their humanitarian and development work Aid agencies are often unable to reach rural areas where the needs are greatest and security is the worst Increasingly aid is channelled through Provincial Reconstruction Teams run by foreign troops and many aid agencies use armed convoys to move around As a result aid workers are seen by the Taliban and other armed groups as being an extension of NATO forces and therefore legitimate targets Dozens of aid workers have been injured kidnapped or killed In May 2011 bin Laden was killed by special forces in northwestern Pakistan By then al Qaeda influence on the Taliban had greatly diminished and analysts were unclear how his death would affect the insurgency 

Reconstruction hurdles Billions of aid dollars have poured into Afghanistan to help rebuild the shattered infrastructure and economy Afghanistan depends on aid for most of its spending But international donors have fallen behind in paying what they have already pledged partly because of concerns about corruption In addition much of the money goes back to donor countries An estimated 40 percent of the 15 billion spent in aid between 2001 and 2008 was returned to donors in corporate profits and consultant salaries the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief ACBAR alliance of aid agencies said in a March 2008 report Local government institutions lack skilled staff and expertise and many of the country district governors do not have an office building ACBAR said too many aid projects are designed to deliver rapid visible results rather than build capacity and ensure sustainable poverty reduction that would reduce Afghanistan dependence on foreign help Most aid has been directed to Kabul or other urban centres rather than to rural areas where it is most needed and more than of Afghans live said the report Spending on aid by all donors between 2001 and 2008 amounted to around million a day according to ACBAR By contrast the military spent some 100 million a day fighting Taliban insurgents The United Nations launched a billion development plan in October 2009 to run from 2010 to 2013 This Development Assistance Framework covers governance peace agriculture food security health education water and sanitation Afghans rank insecurity as their top concern according to a 2010 survey by the Asia Foundation Experts blame the surge in violence on a weak central government banditry a booming narcotics trade and the insurgency Distinguishing between and dealing with the different actors can be hard they say

Underlying causes While individual food emergencies may be triggered by events such as a poor rainy season the chronic vulnerability to hunger is caused by a wide range of underlying factors Poverty One of the very few areas of consensus is that the dominant cause of hunger in Africa is poverty In his seminal 1981 work Poverty and Famines the Indian economist and Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen wrote Starvation is the characteristic of some people not having enough food to eat It is not characteristic of there not being enough food to eat While the latter can be the cause of the former it is but one of many possible causes Sen thesis of entitlement showed how there is almost always enough food to supply the population but those who are in abject poverty are unable to command the resources that is the money to purchase the food More than years later his theories remain tragically relevant An estimated 50 percent of people in Africa survive on less than 1.25 a day according to the World Bank The average life expectancy is only 52 years and few people have access to hospitals or doctors Very low incomes force families to sell off assets such as animals and tools in order to make ends meet Over time this reduces their ability to cope with shocks like the failure of a rainy season because they have nothing to fall back on in times of hardship So a hunger crisis can develop even when markets are well stocked with food because the people who need it most can not afford to buy it In short being poor makes people poorer Low agricultural productivity According to figures from the Partnership to Cut Hunger and Poverty in Africa rural families account for 75 percent of the population in Africa and a large proportion of the hungry malnourished and poor In addition rural small holder farms and firms account for over 80 percent of African agricultural exports and foreign exchange earnings from agriculture Despite this government investment in the sector continues to decline along with production NGO says that Africa has turned from being a food exporter to a net food importer in the past 30 years Crop yields are no higher today than they were in 1980 and the continent share of world agricultural trade has plummeted since 1965 The challenges facing Africa agricultural sector include poor political and economic governance inadequate funding for the agricultural sector poor water resources management and neglect of research and development Foreign investment and donor relief are also lacking According to Julie Howard executive director of the Partnership to Cut Hunger and Poverty in Africa assistance to agriculture in Africa falls far below similar funding for health in Africa Across the continent but especially in the south the spread of has irreparably damaged affected communities compromising their capacity to cope and rendering them increasingly vulnerable to hazards and shocks This is particularly the case when food is scarce creating a new profile of vulnerability to destitution and hunger According to the Joint United Nations Programme on UNAIDS Africa is home to two thirds of all people living with HIV Southern Africa is the most affected region where HIV prevalence rates have stabilised at high levels accounting for more than a third of the world HIV infections and AIDS deaths Elsewhere HIV prevalence has stabilised or is declining at percent or less Whereas conventional famines tend to kill young children and the elderly kills the young adults whose labour traditionally enabled communities to cope with drought and hunger According to this hypothesis known as New Variant Famine and pioneered by Alex de Waal the burden of care for those sick with AIDS cripples families Their livelihoods then collapse and the networks and coping strategies dissolve In short de Waal writes HIV is imperilling the ability of African societies to reproduce themselves Climate change Across the continent climate change and rapid desertification particularly the southward advance of the Sahara into Sahel regions have stripped many communities of traditional farming and pasture land Pastoralists need grass to feed their cattle and the vast majority of farmers are dependent on crops so any disruption in the water supply can have a rapid and catastrophic effect In large parts of Africa especially the Sahel east Africa and the Horn and southern Africa rains have become unreliable and at times The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC said in a 2007 report that Africa will bear the brunt of global warming The body predicted that an increase in greenhouse gas emissions will leave up to 1.8 million more people in Africa without sufficient clean water Meanwhile arid and lands are likely to increase by up to eight per cent with profound consequences for agriculture and food productions Among other predictions the report said wheat may disappear from Africa by the 2080s that the soya bean harvest in Egypt could drop by close to 30 per cent by 2050 under a worst case scenario and that maize yields could fall significantly in Southern Africa Other drivers of climate change include deforestation which leads to desertification The Environment Programme UNEP has said that logging is a central cause of drought in East Africa given the role that dense vegetation such as forests plays in generating rainfall by pumping water held in soil into the air Since independence in 1963 Kenya forest cover has shrunk from 10 percent of its 582,650 224,962-square-mile territory to a mere 1.7 percent altering rain and catchment patterns that are essential for the country agrarian economy Global food prices Soaring global food prices are affecting people ability to feed their families In 2007 and 2008 the global price of many basics including rice wheat and maize shot up triggering riots in many parts of Africa Although global prices have eased since then prices in developing countries remain high Not surprisingly the hardest hit are the poorest especially the urban poor who spend as much as 80 percent of their income on food The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned the situation will worsen conflict in war zones Countries most affected are those experiencing failed harvests forcing them to import large amounts of food Many governments introduced food subsidies or export restrictions to counter rising costs but some critics say these only exacerbated price rises on global markets And the rising price of food combined with fuel price hikes also pushed the cost of food aid just when it was needed most The price rises were caused by a combination of increased demand from India and China a rise in the use of biofuels produced from food crops a spike in transport costs and poor harvests Armed conflict Widespread conflict and the proliferation of small arms have displaced millions of people across Africa While the Sahel and southern Africa have been relatively free of conflict in recent years the Horn of Africa is still wracked by armed violence Guns are at the heart of the problem said the special adviser on internal displacement in 2006 Dennis McNamara He added that the underlying causes of hunger such as violence and political instability can not be solved simply by handing out food In Somalia where 3.6 million people need assistance there has been no central government since 1991 when the country descended into a protracted civil war Aid agencies say that drought exacerbates conflict between nomadic groups in the area as they have to travel hundreds of kilometres in search of pasture The number of weapons in the area makes these encounters increasingly lethal officials say that lawlessness in areas of the Horn of Africa is making it harder to deliver food aid 

From to early September heavy monsoon rains resulted in flooding in all districts in Sindh Province As of September the Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority PDMA reported that floods had resulted in 175 deaths and affected approximately million others in the province including more than 193,000 people displaced to more than 2,000 camps In addition heavy rainfall caused water to breach river banks and irrigation canals accumulating in areas As of September flooding had damaged or destroyed nearly million homes and approximately 1.6 million acres of crops including up to 80 percent of banana date chili sugar cane and cotton crops throughout Sindh In response to the floods the Government of Pakistan GoP mobilized engineering equipment helicopters and personnel including medical and rescue teams to the most affected districts in Sindh to assist with response and evacuation efforts The GoP and agencies also initiated a rapid health assessment in all districts in Sindh as well as two districts in neighboring Balochistan Province On September Charg dAffaires Richard Hoagland issued a disaster declaration due to the effects of the floods In response provided an initial 100,000 through for emergency relief operations in districts in Sindh Province In response to countrywide flooding in Pakistan in 2010 the USG provided more than 922 million in assistance including an estimated 762 million from USAID Many of these previously funded humanitarian activities remain ongoing in areas including the districts in southern Sindh

Last month in a camp set up for flood refugees outside Pakistan southern city of Sukkur agroup of men and boys gathered around the medical tent complaining about the rising cases of stomach infections They give us food that too spicy they said What do they give you I asked a young man Korma he said But they put too many spices in it We do like these spices A relief worker at the camp who overheard our conversation cursed under his breath They get to eat korma every day and still they complain The implication was clear could they afford to eat korma before this flood made them homeless Should they be grateful I heard a similar refrain later in the month when I tried to explain the scale of the devastation to abusinessman friend in an area that had been spared by the floods Did the media ever report on how these people lived before the floods They lived just like they are living now on the road without running water without toilets It not lack of sympathy but lack of imagination Most of the 20 million people affected by the worst floods in the country history lived in abject poverty before but they did live like this They were homeless chasing charity trucks on the country highways They had a roof over their heads The reason we did see them on our television screens was because they were busy eking out a living from the land and fussing over their buffalo their goat or a few chickens Igrew up in a village where a whole family could be raised children sent to schools new clothes bought once a year daughters married off with the income that a buffalo milk brought the initial days of the floods many rescue workers were angry and frustrated when people refused to be rescued without their cattle Not because these animals were like family members but because they were their only revenue stream their life insurance and their children future This was the kind of poverty where people might get to eat korma only at weddings or their landlords funerals but they had some control over the combination of salt and chilli powder they put in their pots It called television journalist accompanying me on avisit to the flood relief camps spent a whole day trying to capture the lives of children in these camps In the evening he told me that he felt disappointed All day I searched through my lens but their faces their eyes do have the kind of desperation the suffering you see after a disaster of such magnitude He said this like a committed professional who was able to do his job properly Maybe it was just lack of empathy I thought It was a kind of emotional blindness caused by watching too much distant suffering on our television screens In an era in which unmanned drones carry out Nintendo wars and 16-year-old boys blow themselves up in mosques and shrines we want our disasters neatly packaged We expect our tragedies to look spectacular and last around five minutes before we are regaled with a human interest story with an uplifting ending There have been those of course a cow did save its owner life and awoman gave birth on the roadside before she was shifted to a camp and given lots of baby clothes But 500,000 women are likely to give birth in similar conditions during the next six months and seven million people are still without shelter three months after the floods what we see on our screens are millions of people living under a charpoy the family bed often the only household item they managed to salvage before water took everything away We see them huddled around a makeshift stove boiling rice borrowing a pinch of salt from each other Sometimes we see them muttering that it Allah will Very occasionally they are blocking a road to protest at the government indifference We see young mothers who have aged rapidly herding their children to a lone hand pump forcing them to take a shower They have not had much training in how to look miserable for our TV list of what flood victims need to rebuild their lives is astonishingly short and inexpensive seed for the next crop fertilisers some form of subsidy on electricity and irrigation water and if you want to be really generous some financial help to rebuild their homes The lucky ones were handed about 170 in cash after they were forced to return to their homes Did they ever see so much cash in their lives Many more have just given up and gone back to their muddy farms and collapsed government and its friends have failed these 20 million people Saudi Arabia and the US two of Pakistan oldest and closest allies and just to remind ourselves the countries at least partially responsible for Pakistan many raging battles have together promised Pakistan 600m in flood aid Yet only this week they have agreed on a 60bn deal for military hardware that includes among other things Black Hawks and Little Birds You ca make korma with the first few weeks the UN secretary general Ban called the flood a tsunami It might have disappeared from our TV screens but it is still moving What survived the flood will be destroyed by our collective lack of imagination and our shrinking attention span Photographer Gideon Mendel travelled with ActionAid SeehisPakistan film at

Based on such and other factors the Panel projected a model based future after analyzing various climate models and predicted that in 21st century surface air warmings best estimate for a low scenario is 1.8 degrees centigrade with a likely average of 1.1 to 2.9 degrees centigrade and for a high scenario 4.0 degrees with a likely range of 2.4 to 6.4 degrees centigrade rise of temperature at a rate of 0.1 degree centigrade per decade in first two decades and for next two rise of about 0.2 degree centigrade For sea level it estimated rise of 18 to 59 cm in low scenario to 26 to 59 cm in a high scenario resulting in increase in frequency in warm spells heat waves heavy rainfall droughts intensified tropical cyclones extreme high tides etc The model provided range of scenarios for temperature and sea level rise Climate change and Bangladesh Effects of climate change are all too visible in Bangladesh According to one study compared to present day temperature by 2100 temperature could increase to 2.4 degrees centigrade higher than the current level causing hotter summer and hot winters The rainfall could increase to 10 by the same time changing drastically usual rainfall patterns The sea water rise would cause more havoc as it is estimated that by 2100 the level would increase by 88 cm than the current level submerging vast tract of land with sea water Frequent and severe floods frequent storms etc have already become regular features and likely to multiply affecting lives of tens and thousands of people who mostly poor and otherwise vulnerable What are human rights got to do with climate change Human rights are universal basic rights and freedoms which all humans are entitled to including civil political economic social and cultural rights entailing such rights as right to life liberty freedom of expression to worship to own property to be treated equally before the law to family to education to culture to health to subsistence etc These rights being universal and fundamental states have obligation to prevent violations of these rights However global warming has been threatening all around human rights which are designed to prevent destruction of life health property livelihood culture means of subsistence residence movement etc The treats from climate change include deaths and danger from droughts floods heat storm rising oceans impacts of agriculture and food production loss of animals sickness from various diseases destruction of water supplies inability to live and sustain lives Forced displacements have already impacted hard and likely to do more so in future with the predicted rise of sea level devastating storms costing huge portion of gross domestic product In Asia and Pacific according to the report of the Working Group on Climate Change titled Up in the Smoke 2007 human drama of climate change will largely be played out in Asia where over 60 percent of the worlds population around billion lives To some extent the relationship between the environment and human rights and human has been recognized According to Commission of Human Rights realizations of many human rights are necessarily related to and in some ways dependent upon ones physical environment International Court of Justice ICJ also views that damage to environment can impair and undermine all human rights Protection of environment according to the Advisory Council of Jurists of the Forum on National Human Rights Institutions is a vital part of the contemporary human rights doctrine and a sine qua non for numerous human rights such a right to health and the right to life Indeed many rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural rights Convention against Torture Convention on the Rights of the Child are relevant to those people whose way of life comes under threat from climate change States therefore have responsibilities under these instruments to take action to remedy the direct and indirect threats to these rights posed by climate change These are positive obligations to protect individuals against the threats of climate change regardless of the causes Climate change discourse and human rights In international negotiations and even in IPCC reports human rights hardly appear as an issue These are overwhelmed by science and economics but not those who matters most the people In human rights discussions in Bangladesh too human rights are not mentioned It appears despite deep and complex interlinks climate change discourses are silent on human rights This has to change and discussion in all earnest should begin to understand full impacts of climate change on human rights Even though it involves some difficult rights issue that might be challenging such as weak enforcement mechanisms under international laws or extraterritorial responsibilities in that ordinarily the government concern has the primary duty to act in case of violations of rights but in the case of climate change responsibility of impacts can not be attributed to the government nearest to hand but countries far away and both public and private entities Therefore what is most needed now is to adopt a human rights based approach to policy and legislative responses to climate change based on international human rights norms and standards ensuring promotion and protection of human rights This should also reflect in mitigation and adaptation priorities Human rights standards should be minimum thresholds for mitigation and adaptation policies

administration plan to spend 1.3 billion a year on economic development in Pakistan what has USAID done Among our results the response to the catastrophic flooding was the most immediate important and visible focus of assistance during 2010 In close cooperation with Pakistani civilian and military counterparts the was first in with the most among the international donors To date USAID has provided over 547 million for relief and recovery efforts USAID assistance has focused on providing shelter food water health services and essential supplies to affected communities and displaced families Last fall the US committed to providing an additional 500 million for flood recovery As the floods began receding USAID financed numerous programs focused on restoring agricultural efforts and businesses For example more than 1.5 million people in areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sindh and Punjab were able to sow their fields because the American people provided them with seeds and fertilizers As the new harvest season approaches we expect to see incomes flowing back to the flood affected areas As we are in the early stages of implementing our initiatives under the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan

Mon Aug 2010 By Alister Doyle Environment Correspondent OSLO Reuters Devastating floods in Pakistan and Russia heatwave match predictions of extremes caused by global warming even though it is impossible to blame mankind for single severe weather events scientists say This year is on track to be the warmest since reliable temperature records began in the century beating 1998 mainly due to a of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels according to the World Meteorological Organization WMO We will always have climate extremes But it looks like climate change is exacerbating the intensity of the extremes said Omar Baddour chief of climate data management applications at WMO headquarters in Geneva It is too early to point to a human fingerprint behind individual weather events he said Recent extremes include mudslides in China and heat records from Finland to Kuwait adding to evidence of a changing climate even as negotiations on a new global treaty for costly cuts in greenhouse gas emissions have stalled Reinsurer Munich Re said a natural catastrophe database it runs shows that the number of extreme weather events like windstorm and floods has tripled since 1980 and the trend is expected to persist The worst floods in Pakistan in 80 years have killed more than 1,600 people and left million homeless Global warming is one reason for the rare spate of weather extremes said Gerstengarbe a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research DOWNPOURS He pointed to the heatwave and related forest fires in Russia floods in Pakistan rains in China and downpours in countries including Germany and Poland We have four such extremes in the last few weeks This is very seldom he said The weather extremes and the chance of a 2010 undercut a view of skeptics that the world is merely witnessing natural swings perhaps caused by variations in the sun output Russia worst drought in decades has led to fires that have almost doubled death rates in Moscow to around 700 per day an official said Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced a grain export ban from August 15 to December 31 Nearly 1,500 people have died in landslides and flooding caused by months of torrential rains across China the Ministry of Civil Affairs said Baddour said one cause of a shift in monsoon rains in Asia seemed to be a effect of La Nina a natural cooling of the Pacific region Scientists say it is impossible to pin the blame for individual events from hurricanes to sandstorms solely on human activities led by burning of fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide Still one study concluded that global warming had doubled the chances of heatwaves similar to a scorching 2003 summer in Europe in which 35,000 people died Those temperatures could not convincingly be explained by natural variations It may be possible to use climate models to determine whether human influences have changed the likelihood of certain types of extreme events the panel of climate scientists said in its latest 2007 report That report said it was at least 90 percent likely that most warming in the past 50 years was caused by mankind a finding questioned by skeptics who have pointed to errors in the report such as an exaggeration of the melt of Himalayan glaciers Warming of the climate is likely to bring more events of this sort said Henning Rodhe professor emeritus of chemical meteorology at Stockholm University of the Russian heatwave But you ca draw the conclusion that this is caused by global warming Most countries agreed at a climate summit in Copenhagen last year to limit a rise in average world temperatures to below degrees Celsius above times a tough goal since temperatures already rose 0.7C in the 20th century The latest round of climate talks in Bonn from August 2-6 ended with growing doubts that a global climate treaty could still be agreed as hoped by some nations in 2010 despite deep splits about sharing the burden of curbs on emissions Senate majority leader Harry Reid has all but abandoned climate change legislation this year The United States the number two greenhouse gas emitter behind China is the only major industrialized nation with no law to cut emissions 

Mixed with the braying of livestock and the welcome laughter of children a new sound swirls above the village of Nakupurat in Kenya these days It is the steady creaking of a windmill For villager Ekiru Ewoi and the 2,000 residents here it is a sound that reminds them daily that the hard days of thirst have passed When the windmill was broken we were going to the river Ekiru says That took the whole day from morning to evening to get water 

On a day in September 2010 a group of men left their mountaintop village in Pakistan and wended their way down 5,000 feet of steep rocky slopes None of them were young one used a cane At the base of the mammoth mountain a river had burst its banks and destroyed the only bridge leading where they needed to go The men waited hours to make a precarious journey across the water on a rope trolleya tiny open crate that swung and wobbled each of them over the river 

Millions of people in southern Africa are at risk of extreme hunger because of a combination of poverty regular bouts of drought and flooding and the worst rates in the world The region has had its share of food crises which forced many to fall back on food aid during periods of severe drought or flood But even in years like 2009 when crop yields are relatively high almost all countries in the region experience pockets of food shortages People are especially vulnerable during the hunger gap the period between harvests when food supplies are particularly low which usually lasts from October to April each year Poverty is the main cause of hunger It means that when crops fail farmers have to sell assets like animals and tools to make ends meet and men are forced to migrate in search of work If harvests continue to fail these coping mechanisms gradually run out and families have nothing to fall back on in times of hardship A hunger crisis can develop even when markets are well stocked with food because the people who need it most can not afford to buy it Poverty also makes it harder for farmers to adapt to climate change Even in relatively wealthy South Africa many farmers are unable to introduce new crops improve irrigation and so on because they do have the means to raise the cash or take out loans AIDS has had a dramatic effect on poverty in the region families have lost their breadwinners and farming has been severely affected AIDS orphans have had to take over the farming affecting crop production and the food security of entire regions See briefing Zimbabwe was once viewed as the breadbasket of the region but controversial government land reforms combined with drought and have crippled the country agriculture In the early 2000s the government took over thousands of commercial farms and settled tens of thousands of black farmers on the new land Critics say the new owners do not have the money expertise or state support necessary to farm the land and many were forced to turn to fishing gold panning and sex work to feed themselves Meanwhile most of the wealthy white farmers who had produced the bulk of Zimbabwe farm exports left Zimbabwe taking with them knowledge and capital See AlertNet Zimbabwe crisis briefing For more see African hunger and Food and hunger briefings

hectares 250,000 acres of farmland submerged In India experts and aid agencies have blamed the government for failing to warn people ahead of the flooding in Bihar and for mishandling relief work Emergency fax messages sent by engineers warning of an impending disaster were ignored in Bihar capital Patna weeks before the disaster struck according to a disaster management official The faxes piled up on one bureaucrat desk because he was on leave and no deputy had been appointed officials say Some people have also accused India of failing to maintain the embankments under a treaty signed with Nepal 50 years ago ANNUAL DELUGE Monsoon seasons in South Asia bring severe storms and flooding every year to wide swathes of Bangladesh India Nepal and Pakistan But climate change is now making things worse as melting glaciers in the Himalayas increase the risk of flooding but cut the supply of fresh water The monsoon is essential for the region agriculture but poor infrastructure and poverty have left communities increasingly to cope with the impact of heavy rains Flooding and landslides claim lives destroy property and crops and increase the prevalence of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever The seasons can be loosely categorised into the northeastern winter monsoon which runs from December to early March and the southwestern summer monsoon which normally lasts from early June to early September and supplies more than 80 percent of annual rainfall The winter monsoon which blows in from the northeast carrying moisture from the Bay of Bengal is also normally responsible for cyclones in India Environmental scientists say South Asia and India in particular is set to be one of the regions by climate change as ever rising temperatures melt the Himalayan glaciers More than 500 million people almost half of India total population living in the Indus Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins rely on the glaciers for their water supply Paradoxically faster melting glaciers increase the risk of rivers bursting their banks because of the larger volumes of water but the fact that they are also receding means that water supplies are reaching as far as they used to Not only that experts say rising temperatures are affecting moderate summer monsoon rainfall which is normally easily absorbed by the earth and recharges the ground water Instead rain now falls in heavier bouts on drier ground which is more prone to flooding and landslides According to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology extreme rain events could reach 100 per year in India more than double the 45 that were common in the 1950s Researchers also say rising temperatures will mean diseases will spread to higher altitudes The worst flooding in recent years hit areas of India Maharashtra state around Mumbai in July 2005 According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies more than 22 million people were affected including 3,400 killed 1,100 people injured and another 450,000 displaced 

USAID Responds to Devastating Floods in Pakistan Heavy rains in late July and August have caused massive flooding across Pakistan As of 16 the deadly flood waters had claimed the lives of a reported 1,400 people washed away close to 900,000 homes decimated crops killed scores of livestock and left billions of dollars worth of damage in their wake The United Nations estimates that more than 15 million people have been affected by the floods and as the monsoon rains continue there is a growing need to address critical health concerns 

ISLAMABAD The first convoy of trucks carrying food from the United Nations World Food Programme WFP arrived in Badin district on Sunday for distribution to thousands of households hit by flooding across Pakistans southern Sindh province Initial distributions plans will see 500,000 of the worst affected people receive a food ration Distributions are expected to start on Monday We have been closely monitoring the unfolding situation and are ready to respond said WFP Pakistan Acting Country Director Dominique Frankefort The situation is clearly critical and deteriorating for many who have seen their entire livelihoods washed away WFP is mobilizing every possible resource to make sure their needs are met as quickly as possible Following a formal request from the Government of Pakistan WFP is working with the National Disaster Management Authority NDMA as well as the provincial authorities other local agencies and partners to provide emergency food rations to those worst affected by the flooding WFP food basket includes wheat flour pulses vegetable oil salt high energy biscuits and specially designed baby food mum to prevent malnutrition Latest government figures indicate that nearly five million people have been affected by flooding following heavy Monsoon rains with lower Sindh province bearing the brunt of the inundations and parts of upper Sindh also affected A joint NDMA WFP and OCHA rapid needs assessment is in 12 districts using questionnaires and methodology that was already prepared as part of contingency planning This will determine the scale and duration of the assistance to be provided by WFP WFP is currently assisting over 1.4 million people affected by the 2010 floods through early recovery programmes that run until the end of 2011 Although WFP is utilizing food from its stocks to respond to the life saving needs of the current floods urgent additional support is required from donors to ensure continued WFP support to the hungry across Pakistan 

Uprooted by war Over 2.2 million Somalis have been forced to flee their homes according to Refugee Agency UNHCR figures for January 2011 More than 1.5 million are displaced internally and at least another 700,000 have fled across the border The displacement figures grew in 2011 as large numbers of people fled severe drought Mogadishu has become so dangerous since 2006 that the majority of its inhabitants have fled leaving entire neighbourhoods empty Many of the uprooted have sought refuge with relatives and friends often sharing cramped rooms with several other families Others are in makeshift shelters So many people are camped along the 15 km 10 mile stretch of road west out of Mogadishu towards the town of Afgoye that the United Nations has said it is probably the largest gathering of displaced people in the world with 410,000 people living there in January 2011 But most of the country displaced are concentrated in southern and central regions where regular drought and high food prices make it hard to scrape a living Hundreds of thousands of Somali refugees have sought asylum in neighbouring countries UNHCR says Hundreds have drowned making the dangerous sea crossing to Yemen which they see as a gateway to wealthier parts of the Middle East and the West Others are crammed into sprawling camps in Dadaab in northeast Kenya which are regularly hit by flooding and drought The Dadaab camps host about 380,000 refugees but they were built in 1991 to accommodate a quarter of that and were officially declared full in 2008 Up to five families share plots designed for one family and more than 40,000 people squat outside the camp Many have also sought asylum in Ethiopia and Djibouti UNHCR says the international community has failed to respond adequately to the plight of Somalia displaced people and aid agencies have suffered a severe shortfall in funding In the absence of a functioning government there is no bilateral aid to Somalia 

Drought and flooding Some of the country displacement is caused by persistent drought A large proportion of rural Somalis are but years of drought have forced many to move their families to towns and villages in search of food and water Agencies say many communities particularly pastoralists have used up all their emergency supplies and will need support for several years to recover In 2011 severe drought gripped large parts of the country and food prices soared Large areas of the country are experiencing a severe food crisis and in July the United Nations declared a famine in the southern Bakool and Lower Shabelle regions of south Somalia It said 2.85 million people overall need emergency food aid Hospitals and aid agencies reported a sharp rise in child hunger levels even in the traditional breadbasket regions of Bay and Lower Shabelle Many fled to Mogadishu or across the border to Kenya and Ethiopia UNHCR said in July 2011 it was struggling to keep pace with the volume of new arrivals A 2010 ban by al Shabaab on aid agencies pushed a growing number of people to flee to areas in search of food and water But local witnesses reported al Shabaab soldiers were preventing people from leaving The rebel group said it was lifting its ban in July 2011 In November 2006 just as the country was emerging from the grip of its worst drought in a decade it was hit by floods that were described as the worst in 50 years They washed away homes roads and bridges in south and central Somalia affecting some 300,000 people 

Health crisis Public infrastructure has crumbled leaving most parts of the country without basic services and contributing to some of the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world Most child deaths are from diarrhoea respiratory infections and malaria according to the Children Fund UNICEF Cholera is endemic in Mogadishu due to an absence of basic sanitation or a centralised water supply system the World Health Organisation WHO says Polio in 2005 from a strain that originated in Nigeria three years after the crippling disease had been wiped out in Somalia Despite the insecurity a vaccination programme was carried out across the country and in early 2008 WHO said the virus had been eradicated again After the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 there were reports of toxic materials being washed up along Somalia shoreline Hundreds of people in fishing communities complained of acute respiratory infections unusual skin conditions bleeding mouths and sudden death after inhaling toxic materials Some experts believe the chemicals including some radioactive material had been illegally dumped in Somalia waters 

Government woes The upheaval following the ousting of military dictator Barre in 1991 displaced some million people and coincided with a serious drought The deadly combination of hunger and displacement pushed almost 4.5 million people more than half the population to the brink of starvation by 1992 according to a report issued five years later It said 300,000 people many of them children died from disease during this catastrophe In 1992 the United States sent in troops ahead of a force but left two years later after tough resistance from warlords including clashes in 1993 that killed 18 soldiers and hundreds of Somali militiamen Memories of this humiliating incident which inspired Hollywood movie Black Hawk Down have left the international community reluctant to get involved in Somalia again The mission was also unable to end the fighting or safeguard humanitarian aid It left in 1995 There have been repeated attempts to restore normal government In 2004 an interim was formed in Kenya as Somalia was considered too dangerous a base The transitional government was plagued from the start by tensions between rival warlords and its arrival in Somalia was delayed by disagreements on where to house the government and whether to accept foreign peacekeepers A faction led by parliamentary speaker Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan decided to base itself in Mogadishu while President Abdullahi Yusuf said it was too dangerous and moved his faction to the provincial city of Jowhar 90 km 55 miles north of the capital The first prime minister of the interim government Mohammed Ali Gedi resigned in late 2007 deeply unpopular for his refusal to negotiate with Islamists He was succeeded by Nur Hassan Hussein Yusuf resigned in December 2008 after becoming increasingly isolated both nationally and internationally He was blamed for hindering a peace process and lost parliamentary support over his decision to sack Hussein Parliament elected a new moderate Islamist president Sheikh Sharif Ahmed in early 2009 Ahmed headed the sharia courts movement that brought some stability to Mogadishu and most of south Somalia in 2006 before Washington main regional ally Ethiopia invaded to oust them His hardline former allies declared war on his government and called him a traitor Ahmed picked Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke to be prime minister in a government intended to end civil conflict Sharmarke resigned in September 2010 over tensions with Ahmed and the following month he was replaced by Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed However Mohamed was forced out by a deal struck in June 2011 in Kampala between the president and speaker of parliament that extended the beleaguered administration mandate by 12 months Most MPs opposed the Kampala agreement and called for the impeachment of Parliamentary Speaker Sharif Hassan for abuse of power Abdiweli Mohamed Ali replaced Mohamed as prime minister in June

Peace deal The civil war ended in 2005 with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement CPA But the road to peace has been rocky with both sides accusing the other of violating the accord Under the agreement the ruling party in Khartoum the National Congress Party gave up half its ministerial posts to the SPLM but held on to the most powerful ministries energy defence justice and internal security Both sides agreed to split billions of dollars of oil revenues Leaders in southern Sudan promised to use the oil money to build infrastructure and construct 10,000 km 6,200 miles of roads within six years Under the CPA the SPLM had the right to form a southern regional government and hold a referendum in 2011 to decide whether it should remain part of Sudan or secede The referendum was one of the most controversial aspects of the CPA Other sources of tension include the division of national wealth demarcation of the border and the integration of government troops and former rebels into joint military units Relations reached crisis point in October 2007 when the SPLM temporarily walked out of the coalition government complaining that Khartoum had not implemented key aspects of the deal In May 2008 clashes in the disputed border state of Abyei displaced tens of thousands and fears of a new civil war After that joint forces began operating in the region And in July 2009 both sides said they accepted a ruling by an independent arbitration court in The Hague over Abyei borders placing the major Heglig and Bamboo oil fields in the north Unresolved issues remain over national elections which were held in April 2010 They were Sudan first elections in 24 years and a key part of the peace process But opposition parties in both the north and south boycotted the polls saying the conditions for elections were unconstitutional and undemocratic They had called for the polls to be postponed until a genuinely inclusive transitional government was established that would implement reforms needed for free and fair voting President Bashir and his National Congress Party NCP won the national presidential and parliamentary polls Salva Kiir was elected southern president and his SPLM swept the board in the south 

Building a new state The southern government faces many challenges as it builds a new state both within its borders and from the north ISSUES Negotiations between the north and south have so far failed to resolve some key issues from the 2005 peace deal Both Khartoum and South Sudan are heavily dependent on oil revenues and the division of oil wealth is still under discussion The majority of Sudan oil comes from the south but all the infrastructure to export it pipelines refineries and Red Sea port is in the north Under the peace deal Khartoum received half of the revenues from oil found in the south once pipeline fees and other costs had been deducted The demarcation of the 2,000 kilometre border has not yet been resolved In June 2011 both sides agreed to form a demilitarized buffer zone to be monitored by international peacekeepers and independent observers The citizenship and status of southerners living in the north is also a contentious issue amid reports from human rights observers that southerners have received threats to their lives and property In December 2010 Bashir said that if the south seceded he wanted to create north Sudan as an state This raises questions over the status of southerners living in the north and other minority African and Christian sections of the population Three border states Abyei Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile are potential flashpoints between the north and south and there has been a of forces and arms in all three states Many people in the states fought alongside the southern Sudanese in the civil war Under the 2005 peace deal Abyei has the option of holding a referendum to decide whether to join the north or the south But people in the north Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states feel betrayed by the peace deal because it did not give them the same option ABYEI The status of the Abyei state is unresolved A referendum over whether the state will join the north or the south was promised under the 2005 peace deal but has not yet taken place because the north and south can not agree the terms of the vote The state has seen several outbreaks of fighting between north and south troops since 2005 and the research group Small Arms Survey has reported a gradual of troops in the area In May 2011 Khartoum seized Abyei forcing more than 100,000 people to flee fighting according to figures The following month both north and south agreed to demilitarize Abyei and allow troops to monitor the peace The United Nations established a new peacekeeping force called the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei UNISFA Tensions are also high between the Missiriya tribe and the Ngok Dinka who want Abyei to join South Sudan The Ngok Dinka are demanding that voting in the referendum be limited to those who have lived in the area uninterrupted for a long period This would exclude the Missiriya who migrate with their cattle seasonally The Missiriya have threatened war if they are not given ballots The Missiriya have repeatedly disrupted attempts to demarcate the border in Abyei Archbishop Daniel Deng Bul of the Episcopal Church of Sudan said in October 2010 Many fear they will lose grazing rights and their livelihoods if an international border runs through their grazing land even though these rights are enshrined in the 2005 peace deal The Khartoum government armed many Missiriya to fight as proxy militias in the civil war SOUTHERN KORDOFAN Southern Kordofan lies in north Sudan along the disputed border with South Sudan It is home to the most productive oil fields under Khartoum control and both the north and south have built up armed forces and weapons in the state Many in the state sided with the southern rebels during the civil war and Khartoum responded by arming Arab militias In 1992 the governor of Southern Kordofan formally declared a jihad or holy war in the Nuba Mountains According to Foreign Policy the campaign included the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population starvation murder rape enslavement and land seizure Hundreds of thousands of Nuba people from several black African tribes were forcibly displaced and as many as 200,000 people died The north forces targeted Muslims as well as Christians and animists Unlike Abyei the 2005 peace deal that ended the civil war did not give the people of Southern Kordofan the right to choose whether to join the north or south Many Nuba are demanding political reform and autonomy and thousands still serve in a rebel armed force The northern branch of the SPLM says it was cheated of victory in the state May 2011 governorship elections The NCP Ahmed Haroun who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes in Darfur was declared winner and soon afterwards former SPLM fighters were ordered to disarm In early June 2011 clashes broke out in the Nuba Mountains between the northern army and forces Tens of thousands of civilians were forced to flee according to reports We are facing the nightmare of genocide of our people in a final attempt to erase our culture and society from the face of the earth the Episcopal Bishop of Kadugli and the Nuba Mountains Andudu Adam said Activists say northern troops and Arab militias targeted Nuba civilians carrying out bombing campaigns and going house to house killing people Khartoum has denied the allegations The northern government accused the northern branch of the SPLM of launching an uprising to try and seize control of the state ahead of the July 2011 secession DOMESTIC ISSUES The southern government was created from a liberation movement with allied militias and its transformation from this to becoming a civilian democratic government will take a lot of work experts say The south has lost many of its best and brightest to the diaspora and many of those who remained to fight for freedom and independence are poorly educated and lack the skills to build a new government and economy from scratch Sudan expert Eric Reeves said Much of the government budget is currently spent on the military and there is little left over to spend on development in a region with few public services and very little infrastructure Armed groups are an ongoing threat to stability ARMED THREATS TO SOUTH SUDAN FRAGILE PEACE Threats to peace in the south include not just tensions with the north and a of arms on both sides of the disputed border but also tensions within South Sudan itself South Sudan is awash with small arms and now that southerners have achieved their common goal independence from the rest of Sudan experts fear tensions will resurface between the southern government and its dissenters The 2005 peace agreement did not address some key areas affecting security in the south It recognised only the SPLM leaving out smaller armed groups in the south whose demands for a share of power and resources were similar to those of the SPLM The peace deal also did not address the potential for despite rivalry between two main ethnic groups the Dinka and Nuer That rivalry was exacerbated by the Khartoum government which has manipulated tension between Sudan various ethnic groups for its own advantage In 2010 several armed groups formed after Sudan national elections The SPLM swept the board at the April polls further estranging many opposition groups who said the southern government and army was dominated by the Dinka ethnic group They also accused it of corruption the advocacy group Enough Project said in a March 2011 report Although several armed groups afterwards signed peace deals with the southern government one of them led by George Athor in Jonglei State renewed fighting after the referendum on independence Other active armed groups are based in Unity State and Jonglei State Tribal clashes over land water and cattle are also common displacing tens of thousands of people each year and many communities have refused to disarm as a result The United Nations said about 80,000 people were displaced in the Lakes and Western Equatoria states between January and March 2011 alone The Ugandan Lord Resistance Army LRA is also active in the south particularly in Western Equatoria state abducting children and forcing thousands to flee their homes every year Many aid workers are forced to use armed escorts to travel in the state The SPLM has accused Khartoum of using some armed groups including the LRA as proxies to destabilise the region Khartoum denies the accusations

Villagers fleeing from flooded affected areas shout slogans as they make a road block to protest against the delay in flood relief in the Badin district of Pakistan Sindh province September 17 2011 Soomro By Rebecca Conway PANGRIO Pakistan Sept 18 Reuters The family of 12 were relieved when a Pakistani army boat rescued them from flood waters a week ago But the hardships have only piled up at a makeshift camp The few family possessions saved from the roaring waters have been sold to buy food The children have picked up potentially fatal diseases but ca afford to rest And Pakistan government is nowhere to be found The children have been begging in the market to get food and from the passing cars said Ahmed Junejo one of almost million people displaced by floods which have ravaged Sindh province in the south Like many flood victims the Junejo family are resigned to the fact they will have to fend for themselves I just need two things food and a tent to protect my children from the sun and the rain That what we need here said Ahmed 50 Nobody has come to even look at us so we do know where the relief camps are and nobody had told us about any aid being delivered anywhere We are still waiting for someone to come It could be a while Pakistan government has been slow to respond to the floods which have killed over 300 people and damaged or destroyed about 1.2 million houses since monsoon rains triggered the crisis in late August It a repeat performance of last year when authorities failed to ease the suffering of millions hit by epic floods in July and August prompting the military to take charge Some 800,000 families hit by that calamity remain homeless 

The country is likely to import vegetables from India in October like last year when floods had destroyed vast swathes of farmland said Haji Shah Jehan the President of the Welfare Association of Wholesale Vegetable Markets in and fruit supplies have dropped by 75 per cent and prices have shot up by nearly 100 per cent in the wholesale market due to heavy monsoon rainfall and flooding he said The natural calamity has destroyed the agricultural supply chain Shah Jehan told The News 800 to 1,000 trucks of fruits and vegetables arrive at the Karachi wholesale market every day but after the rains began the number dropped to 200 to 250 situation will become clearer in a week or two when floodwaters recede in the districts of Sindh he of vegetables were affected more than fruit as supplies from the Balochistan and Punjab provinces were are mostly grown in Sindh which was badly hit by the recent rains have disrupted the supply of vegetables from the Thatta Tando Allahyar Tando Muhammad Khan Badin Sanghar and Mirpurkhas Jehan noted that the were small farmers and asked the government to provide them relief in the form of a subsidy on seed and rains in Sindh have resulted in losses of around Rs 256 billion to major kharif crops and sugarcane crops survived the rains while cotton and paddy were the and animal fodder that were being grown in the fields were also washed away by the flood a decline in supply the rain has affected business at Karachi wholesale market with Shah Jehan complaining that the Mandi had become unhygienic after rains in the city The market is filthy after the rains The air reeks with rotting fruits and vegetables the gutters are choked and there is mud everywhere Shah Jehan wholesale market for fruits and vegetables on the Super Highway on the outskirts of Karachi is the biggest in Pakistan and is spread over 100 market supplies fruits and vegetables to the country largest city with a population of around 18 million and normally caters to export demand as deluge in Sindh has killed over 300 people and affected six million at a time when the southern province is still grappling with the impact of last year unprecedented flooding

trail of misery that is hard to recover from It wouldnt be inappropriate to say that not only were the floods avoidable because of their very nature the destruction brought about by the water flows would have been much more controllable had the state paid any attention to its constitutional obligation of delivering on peoples right to live right to equality and access to social services We at the Sindh Peoples Commission on Disaster Prevention and Management SPCDPM are firmly of the view that these floods were very much avoidable and there were great number of opportunities to ensure that the floods caused minimum damage to the population A few points drawn from extensive discussions held at various meetings organised by the SPCDPM and from experts reports are presented here to support our arguments LBOD is largely responsible for the catastrophe It is noteworthy that one element responsible for the floods in the month of August this year was multiple breaches in the Left Bank Outfall Drain which in the past had been repeatedly criticised for its faulty design that exposes the local communities living alongside the area to great number of risks in case of heavy rainfalls This is not the first time that the LBOD has severely affected and displaced the population of Badin The 1999 cyclone 2003 monsoon and 2006 rains caused overflows and breaches that displaced the population of Badin and adjacent areas and also caused loss of lives The maintenance and management of the LBOD and the sim nalas that too overflowed this year has remained a neglected affair due to extreme corruption and capacity deficits of the Public Works and the Irrigation Departments of the province It is pertinent to note that sim nalas demand extra care and maintenance since they serve the purpose of draining out effluents that weakens the drainage structures There have been no serious efforts to maintain the nalas over the years due to a lack of interest on the part of the government and the concerned departments thatare full of political appointees compromising merit and capacity To add salt to the injury the Sindh government completely ignored Badin district and Left Bank Outfall Drain LBOD in the Sindh Flood Contingency Plan 2011 rendering the floods as a complete catastrophe Independent reports suggests that had the contingency plan identified vulnerable embankments and carried out repair work in the LBOD prior to the monsoon season the losses could have been considerably minimised Underdevelopment of Sindh intensified the miseries Sindh presents an extremely grim picture in terms of access to basic services as well as the rights of the citizens in the rural areas In the context of the development there are wide disparities between rural and urban Sindh as the social indicators of urban Sindh equal or surpass the level of development in other developing countries with comparable per capita income The level of human development in rural Sindh is worse than in some of the African countries Two out of every five of the citizens of rural Sindh live below the poverty line Early this year data released by the Sindh Department of Health indicated a Global Acute Malnutrition GAM rate of 21.2-23.1 per cent in children aged between 6-59 months in areas of Sindh This rate is well above the World Health Organizations WHO 15 per cent emergency threshold level which triggers a humanitarian response Furthermore records from Northern Sindh reveal a Severe Acute Malnutrition SAM rate of 6.1 The Sindh government estimates about 90,000 children aged 6-59 months are malnourished In terms of children 73 percent girls and 63 percent boys in the province remain out of school according to the Sindh Education Management Information Systems In rural Sindh out of every 10 newborns are delivered without proper medical supervision According to the Pakistan Social Living Standards Measurement Survey PSLM the immunization rate among children in rural Sindh children is extremely low 28 children of Rural Sindh between 12-23 months of age have been fully immunized to Punjab 54 and rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 48 Sindh has the highest incidence of absolute landlessness 62 or two million households highest share of tenancy 11 or 300,000 households and the lowest share of land ownership 26 or 700,000 households in the country as pointed out in a report Social Development in Pakistan Annual Review 2004 The land holding in the province is characterised by small holdings with 62 of small farmers owning less than acres restricting modern mechanized agriculture Yet more than 70 of the rural population derives their livelihood from agriculture livestock forestry and fishing The organized manufacturing and services sectors have minimal presence in the rural areas Rural Sindh is highly dependent on public services with little role of the private sector According to the latest Household Integrated Economic Survey HIES rural Sindhs household described as poor have 9.11 members on average with only 276 persons per household employed In the Punjab an average household of 7.94 members has 2.31 persons per household benefitting from employment Groundwater is the principal source of drinking water for the majority of people in Pakistan While about 80 of the Punjab Province has fresh groundwater in Sindh less than 30 of groundwater is fresh Much of the province is underlain by highly brackish water with some instances of elevated fluoride levels In terms of housing too rural Sindh has the highest percentage of population 35 percent living in one room accommodation The PSLM Survey reports over 47 of the rural houses in Sindh made of mud bricks compared to 22 percent in Punjab and 28 percent in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa though faring below 79 percent in Balochistan The mud brick structure makes these houses prone to threats of damage in the event of floods or other disasters The four districts Badin Mirpurkhas Sanghar and Thatta hit by the floods represent 27 of the rural population of Sindh province with widespread poverty and incidence of bonded labour prevalent in the region The cases of bonded labour flow from the existence of an unequal sharecropping tenancy system as well as the presence of brick establishments in the region that has over the years come to become a stronghold of bondage for workers involved in the sector Gender disparity both in terms of access to social services as well as cultural norms is acute in the Province of Sindh For every 100 boys being immunized in urban Sindh only 70 girls get immunized in rural areas For every 100 boys enrolling in primary school in urban Sindh only 43 girls do so in rural Sindh Sindh also represents worst gender ratio in the country for every 100 males in Sindh there are only 89 females Age old tribal traditions including the culture of honour and violence against women as a source of cultural pride continue to exist in the province Back to floods No lessons learnt During last years floods too Sindh suffered immense misery despite the government having adequate time to prepare and prevent widespread losses Seventeen districts of Sindh were affected by the floods last year making it the second most affected province following 24 districts devastated by the floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Around 182,1479 people stayed in 4,632 relief camps set up by the government during last years floods Sindh suffered economic losses especially in the area of agriculture and livestock According to a report by the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations during 2010 floods Sindh suffered the highest damage to Kharif crops with 60 percent of the cotton crops 64 percent of the sugarcane cultivation and 100 percent of rice crops estimated to be damaged by the floods The Livestock Department of Sindh estimates that more than 40 percent of the 40million cattle heads perished due to floods in the province while majority of the animals developed various diseases Fish farms too suffered as most of the farms are located in Thatta Badin and Dadu three districts listed amongst the districts of the province State representatives themselves expressed dissatisfaction with the repair work undertaken last year with Chairman of the Monitoring Committee on Rehabilitation Works on Canals and Dykes Dr Ahmad Ali Shah voicing apprehension over right bank canals capacity to sustain floodwater when it would be released into the system because of unsatisfactory repairs carried out since last year floods It is indeed a point of grave concern that despite the heavy losses of the 2010 floods the government took a very long time to come into action after the district Badin was hit by floods in August 2011 In a press report on August 18 the Sindh CM categorically stated that there is no need for international assistance while the miseries of the affectees kept piling up It was only on Sept that the government announced that it is contemplating launching an international appeal for help This is even more astonishing since according to governments own figures till Aug 27 over million people were already distressed by the floods and while 9,367 villages remained under water Sadly local NGOs and humanitarian bodies too did little to offer assistance running extensive assessment exercise while seeking funds from local and international donors The situation of food shortage inadequate shelter and access to clean drinking water kept multiplying all this while According to the 2000 Agricultural Census nearly one million households in Sindh earn their entire livelihood from rearing livestock There are another million households that farm and raise livestock to supplement their incomes The recent floods according to official figures have perished over 14,000 cattle heads The government estimates 25percent of the provinces standing paddy crop to have been destroyed by the floods The initial estimate of losses released by the Sindh Agriculture Department on Sept showed that the flooding of the fields had destroyed a third of the total kharif crop while another private estimate reports the losses to rural economy at Rs 250 billion The performance of the NDMA has been most dismal in this case as the relief measures undertaken by the authority fell short of the requirements on the ground The NDMA PDMA and the government are currently indulging in a pass the buck exercise each blaming the other for not responding adequately to the crisis Speaker National Assembly Fehmida Mirza even called for the closure of the NDMA for its ineffectiveness while in a latest controversy the NDMA has pointed to the government for sitting on Rs billion of unused funds for flood affectees collected last year All this at a time when eight million people in Sindh and Balochistan are facing acute difficulties is a matter of utter shame We at SPCDPM demand immediate measures for the relief and rehabilitation of flood affectees The state must establish a functional and credible coordination mechanism to the relief efforts The compensation mechanism needs to be swift and deliverable without bureaucratic hitches Most importantly the state must undertake serious rehabilitation measures once the relief period is over The rehabilitation phase must be based on the premises of establishing a new social contract with the affectees that should end the sense of marginalisation disempowerment and deprivation that has long characterised the relations in the parts of Sindh and Pakistan Dawn Rain disaster in Sindh Govt to launch international appeal for help Sept 2011 http 3d About AHRC The Asian Human Rights Commission

overwhelming majority of Somalis speak the Somali language which is part of the Cushitic branch of the language family Ethnic Somalis number around 15-17 million and are principally concentrated in Somalia more than million Ethiopia 4.6 million Yemen a little under million northeastern Kenya 900,000 Another plausible etymology proposes that the term Somali is derived from the Arabic for wealthy dhawamaal again referring to Somali riches in livestock An Ancient Chinese document from the 9th century referred to the northern Somali coastwhich was then called Berbera by Arab geographers in reference to the region Berber Cushitic inhabitantsas The first clear written reference of the sobriquet Somali however dates back to the 15th century During the wars between the Sultanate of Ifat based at Zeila and the Solomonic Dynasty the Abyssinian emperor had one of his court officials compose a hymn celebrating a military victory over the Sultan of Ifat eponymous troops History defeated several Ethiopian emperors and embarked on a conquest which brought of Ethiopia under the power of the Muslim Sultanate of Adal In antiquity the ancestors of the Somali people were an important link in the Horn of Africa connecting the region commerce with the rest of the ancient world Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of frankincense myrrh and spices items which were considered valuable luxuries by the Ancient Egyptians Phoenicians Mycenaeans and Babylonians According to most scholars the ancient Land of Punt and its inhabitants formed part of the ethnogenesis of the Somali people The ancient Puntites were a nation of people that had close relations with Pharaonic Egypt during the times of Pharaoh Sahure and Queen Hatshepsut The pyramidal structures temples and ancient houses of dressed stone littered around Somalia are said to date from this period In the classical era several ancient such as Opone Mosyllon and Malao that competed with the Sabaeans Parthians and Axumites for the wealthy trade also flourished in Somalia of Gondershe Somalia was an important city in the medieval Ajuuraan Empire The birth of Islam on the opposite side of Somalia Red Sea coast meant that Somali merchants sailors and expatriates living in the Arabian Peninsula gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted Arab Muslim trading partners With the migration of fleeing Muslim families from the Islamic world to Somalia in the early centuries of Islam and the peaceful conversion of the Somali population by Somali Muslim scholars in the following centuries the ancient eventually transformed into Islamic Mogadishu Berbera Zeila Barawa and Merca which were part of the Berberi civilization The city of Mogadishu came to be known as the City of Islam and controlled the East African gold trade for several centuries a prominent Somali leader and the 20th Sultan of the Warsangali Sultanate In the Middle Ages several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade including the Ajuuraan State which excelled in hydraulic engineering and fortress building the Sultanate of Adal whose general Ahmed Gurey was the first commander to use cannon warfare on the continent during Adal conquest of the Ethiopian Empire and the Gobroon Dynasty whose military dominance forced governors of the Omani empire north of the city of Lamu to pay tribute to the Somali Sultan Ahmed Yusuf In the late 19th century after the Berlin conference had ended European empires sailed with their armies to the Horn of Africa The imperial clouds wavering over Somalia alarmed the Dervish leader Muhammad Abdullah Hassan who gathered Somali soldiers from across the Horn of Africa and began one of the longest colonial resistance wars ever The Dervish State successfully repulsed the British empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region As a result of its successes against the British the Dervish State received support from the Ottoman and German empires The Turks also named Hassan Emir of the Somali nation and the Germans promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 when Britain for the first time in Africa used airplanes to bomb the Dervish capital of Taleex As a result of this bombardment former Dervish territories were turned into a protectorate of Britain Italy similarly faced the same opposition from Somali Sultans and armies and did not acquire full control of parts of modern Somalia until the Fascist era in late 1927 This occupation lasted till 1941 and was replaced by a British military administration The Union of the two regions in 1960 formed the Somali Democratic Republic that would actively pursue a Greater Somalia policy of uniting all of the Somali inhabited regions of the Horn of Africa also known as Somali Galbeed or Western Somalia and the rest of Greater Somalia united as one country Somali people in the Horn of Africa are divided among different countries Somalia Djibouti Ethiopia and northeastern Kenya that were artificially and some might say arbitrarily partitioned by the former imperial powers is an ideology that advocates the unification of all ethnic Somalis once part of Somali empires such as the Ajuuraan Empire the Adal Sultanate the Gobroon Dynasty and the Dervish State under one flag and one nation The Siad Barre regime actively promoted which eventually led to the Ogaden War between Somalia on one side and

leader Genetics Genetic genealogy although a new tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins has also helped pinpoint the possible background of the modern Somalis Y DNA According to Y chromosome studies by Sanchez et al 2005 and Cruciani et al 2004 the Somalis are paternally closely related to certain Ethiopian groups particularly Cushitic speakers The data suggest that the male Somali population is a branch of the East African population closely related to the Oromos in Ethiopia and North Kenya with predominant cluster lineages that were introduced into the Somali population 40005000 years ago and that the Somali male population has approximately 15 Y chromosomes from Eurasia and approximately from Africa Besides comprising the majority of the Y DNA in Somalis the formerly genetic haplogroup also makes up a significant proportion of the paternal DNA of Ethiopians Sudanese Egyptians Berbers North African Arabs as well as many Mediterranean and Balkan Europeans The subclade of is found in about 77 of Somali males which according to Cruciani et al 2007 may represent the traces of an ancient migration into the Horn of Africa from After haplogroup the second most frequently occurring Y DNA haplogroup among Somalis is the Eurasian haplogroup T which is found in slightly more than 10 of Somali males Haplogroup T like haplogroup is also typically found among populations of Northeast Africa North Africa the Near East and the Mediterranean mtDNA According to mtDNA studies by Holden 2005 and Richards et al 2006 a significant proportion of the maternal lineages of Somalis consists of the haplogroup which is common among Ethiopians and North Africans particularly Egyptians and Algerians is believed to have originated in Asia where its parent M clade represents the majority of mtDNA lineages particularly in India This haplogroup is also thought to possibly correlate with the language family Another mtDNA study indicates that Somali as a representative East African population seem to have experienced a detectable amount of Caucasoid maternal influence the proportion m of Caucasoid lineages in the Somali is m 0.46 46 Our results agree with the hypothesis of a maternal influence of Caucasoid lineages in East Africa although its contribution seems to be higher than previously reported in mtDNA studies Overall these genetic studies conclude that Somalis and their fellow Ethiopian and Eritrean Northeast African populations represent a unique and distinct biological group on the continent The most distinct separation is between African and populations The that is the Ethiopian and Somali populations are located centrally between African and populations The fact that the Ethiopians and Somalis have a subset of the African haplotype diversity and that the populations have a subset of the diversity present in Ethiopians and Somalis makes models less likely rather these observations support the hypothesis proposed by other studies Tishkoff et al 1996a 1998a 1998b Kidd et al 1998 that populations in northeastern Africa may have diverged from those in the rest of Africa early in the history of modern African populations and that a subset of this population migrated out of Africa and populated the rest of the globe These conclusions are supported by recent mtDNA analysis et al 1999 According to Mohamoud et al 2006 HLA antigens of the Somali population are not categorised as well as those of other international ethnic groups We analysed the HLA antigens of 76 unrelated Somalis who lived in the west of England HLA and typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide probes at a resolution level Phenotype frequency gene frequency and haplotype frequency were used to study the relationship between Somalis and other relevant populations The antigens with highest frequencies were HLA and and and DR 13 and HLA haplotypes with high significance and characteristics of the Somali population are The result of HLA class I and class II antigen frequencies show that the Somali population appear more similar to Arab or Caucasoid than to African populations The results are consistent with hypothesis supported by cultural and historical evidence of common origin of the Somali population although a few are also adherents of the Shia Muslim denomination ed coral stone city of Merca is an ancient Islamic center in Somalia schools also known as duqsi remain the basic system of traditional religious instruction in Somalia They provide Islamic education for children thereby filling a clear religious and social role in the country Known as the most stable local system of education providing basic religious and moral instruction their strength rests on community support and their use of and widely available teaching materials The system which teaches the greatest number of students relative to other educational is oftentimes the only system accessible to Somalis in nomadic as compared to urban areas A study from 1993 found among other things that unlike in primary schools where gender disparity is enormous around 40 per cent of school pupils are girls but the teaching staff have minimum or no qualification necessary to ensure intellectual development of children To address these concerns the Somali government on its own part subsequently established the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs under which education is now regulated In the Somali diaspora multiple Islamic fundraising events are held every year in cities like Birmingham London Toronto and Minneapolis where Somali scholars and professionals give lectures and answer questions from the audience The purpose of these events is usually to raise money for new schools or universities in Somalia to help Somalis that have suffered as a consequence of floods droughts or to gather funds for the creation of new mosques like the Mosque which is currently undergoing construction in the Twin cities In addition the Somali community has produced numerous important Muslim figures over the centuries many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Islamic learning and practice in the Horn of Africa the Arabian Peninsula and well beyond Important Islamic figures Sheikh Uways 18471909 Somali scholar credited with reviving Islam in 19th century

people are important social units and clan membership plays a central part in Somali culture and politics Clans are patrilineal and are often divided into sometimes with many Somali society is traditionally ethnically endogamous So to extend ties of alliance marriage is often to another ethnic Somali from a different clan Thus for example a recent study observed that in 89 marriages contracted by men of the Dhulbahante clan 55 62 were with women of Dhulbahante other than those of their husbands 30 33.7 were with women of surrounding clans of other clan families Isaaq 28 Hawiye

of Somali is unknown One source estimates that there are 7.78 million speakers of Somali in Somalia itself and 12.65 million speakers globally The Somali language is spoken by ethnic Somalis in Somalia Djibouti Ethiopia Yemen and Kenya and by the Somali diaspora Somali dialects are divided into three main groups Northern Benaadir and Maay Northern Somali or Somali forms the basis for Standard Somali Benaadir also known as Coastal Somali is spoken on the Benadir coast from Cadaley to south of Merca including Mogadishu as well as in the immediate hinterland The coastal dialects have additional phonemes which do not exist in Standard Somali Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle Rahanweyn clans in the southern areas of Somalia Since Somali had long lost its ancient script The script was developed by the Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed specifically for the Somali language and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except p v and z Besides Ahmed Latin script other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing Somali include the Arabic script and Wadaad writing Indigenous writing systems developed in the twentieth century include the Osmanya Borama and Kaddare scripts which were invented by Osman Yusuf Kenadid Sheikh Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur and Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare respectively Culture a traditional Somali shortsword The culture of Somalia is an amalgamation of traditions indigenously developed or accumulated over a timeline spanning several millennia of Somali civilization interaction through cultural diffusion with neighbouring and far away civilizations such as Ethiopia Yemen India and Persia The communities in Somalia are a continuation of an ancient textile industry as is the culture of wood carving pottery and monumental architecture that dominates Somali interiors and landscapes The cultural diffusion of Somali commercial enterprise can be detected in its exotic cuisine which contains Southeast Asian influences Due to the Somali people passionate love for and facility with poetry Somalia has often been referred to by scholars as a Nation of Poets and a Nation of Bards including among others the Canadian novelist Margaret Laurence All of these traditions including festivals martial arts dress literature sport and games such as Shax have immensely contributed to the enrichment of Somali heritage Music Somalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali folklore Most Somali songs are pentatonic that is they only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic seven note scale such as the major scale At first listen Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia Sudan or Arabia but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists midho songwriters lahan and singers or voice Musicians and bands performing with his band Magool May

been cases in the past of artistic depictions representing living creatures such as the golden birds on the Mogadishan canopies the ancient rock paintings in northern Somalia and the plant decorations on religious tombs in southern Somalia but these are considered rare Instead intricate patterns and geometric designs bold colors and monumental architecture were the norm Cinema and theatre Growing out of the Somali people rich storytelling tradition the first few Somali films and cinematic festivals emerged in the early 1960s immediately after independence Following the creation of the Somali Film Agency SFA regulatory body in 1975 the local film scene began to expand rapidly In the 1970s and early 1980s popular musicals known as Riwaayado were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry Epic and period films as well as international followed suit facilitated by the proliferation of video technology and national television networks In the 1990s and 2000s a new wave of more movies emerged Referred to as Somaliwood this upstart cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines marketing strategies and production techniques The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are at the forefront of this quiet revolution Attire Men When not dressed in Westernized clothing such as jeans and Somali men typically wear the macawis which is a garment worn around the waist On their heads they often wrap a colorful turban or wear the koofiyad an embroidered fez Due to Somalia proximity to and close ties with the Arabian Peninsula many Somali men also wear the jellabiya jellabiyad in Somali a long white garment common in the Arab world Women During regular activities women usually wear the guntiino a long stretch of cloth tied over the shoulder and draped around the waist In more formal settings such as weddings or religious celebrations like Eid women wear the dirac which is a long light diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or polyester that is worn over a and a brassiere Married women tend to sport referred to as shash and also often cover their upper body with a shawl known as garbasaar Unmarried or young women however do not always cover their heads Traditional Arabian garb such as the jilbab is also commonly worn Cuisine is a staple of Somali cuisine Somali cuisine varies from region to region and consists of an exotic mixture of diverse culinary influences It is the product of Somalia rich tradition of trade and commerce Despite the variety there remains one thing that unites the various regional cuisines all food is served halal There are therefore no pork dishes alcohol is not served nothing that died on its own is eaten and no blood is incorporated Qado or lunch is often elaborate Varieties of bariis rice the most popular probably being basmati usually serve as the main dish Spices like cumin cardamom cloves cinnamon and sage are used to aromatize these different rice dishes Somalis eat dinner as late as pm During Ramadan dinner is often served after Tarawih prayers sometimes as late as 11 pm Xalwo or halva is a popular confection eaten during special occasions such as Eid celebrations or wedding receptions It is made from sugar corn starch cardamom powder nutmeg powder and ghee Peanuts are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor After meals homes are traditionally perfumed using frankincense lubaan or incense cuunsi which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a dabqaad Literature Somali scholars have for centuries produced many notable examples of Islamic literature ranging from poetry to Hadith With the adoption of the Latin alphabet in 1972 to transcribe the Somali language numerous contemporary Somali authors have also released novels some of which have gone on to receive worldwide acclaim Of these modern writers Nuruddin Farah is probably the most celebrated Books such as From a Crooked Rib and Links are considered important literary achievements works which have earned Farah among other accolades the 1998 Neustadt International Prize for Literature Farah Mohamed Jama Awl is another prominent Somali writer who is perhaps best known for his Dervish era novel Ignorance is the enemy of love Authors and poets Mohamed Ibrahim Warsame songwriter philosopher and Somali Poet Laureate also dubbed the Somali Shakespeare Nuruddin Farah b 1943 Somali writer considered one of the greatest contemporary writers in the world Timacade 19201973 prominent Somali poet

field of theatre criticism is Somali Drama Historical and Critical Study 1987 Farah Mohamed Jama Awl famous Somali author best known for his historical fiction novels Law Somalis for centuries have practiced a form of customary law which they call Xeer Xeer is a polycentric legal system where there is no monopolistic agent that determines what the law should be or how it should be interpreted tree where judges arbitrate a dispute until both parties are satisfied This process can sometimes lead to several days worth of discussions The Xeer legal system is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century There is no evidence that it developed elsewhere or was greatly influenced by any foreign legal system The fact that Somali legal terminology is practically devoid of loan words from foreign languages suggests that Xeer is truly indigenous The Xeer legal system also requires a certain amount of specialization of different functions within the legal framework Thus one can find odayal judges xeer boggeyaal jurists guurtiyaal detectives garxajiyaal attorneys murkhaatiyal witnesses and waranle police officers to enforce the law Xeer is defined by a few fundamental tenets that are immutable and which closely approximate the principle of jus cogens in international law Payment of blood money locally referred to as diya Assuring good relations by treating women justly negotiating with peace emissaries in good faith and sparing the lives of groups children women the pious poets and guests Family obligations such as the payment of dowry and sanctions for eloping Rules pertaining to the management of resources such as the use of pasture land water and other natural resources Providing financial support to married female relatives and Donating livestock and other assets to the poor Architecture Somali architecture is a rich and diverse tradition of engineering and designing involving multiple different construction types such as stone cities castles citadels fortresses mosques temples aqueducts lighthouses towers and tombs Spanning the ancient medieval and early modern periods in Somalia it also includes the fusion of architecture with Western designs in contemporary times In ancient Somalia pyramidical structures known in Somali as taalo were a popular burial style with hundreds of these drystone monuments scattered around the country today Houses were built of dressed stone similar to the ones in Ancient Egypt Somali studies scholar Said Sheikh Samatar The scholarly term for research concerning Somalis and Somalia is known as Somali Studies It consists of several disciplines such as anthropology sociology linguistics historiography and archaeology The field draws from old Somali chronicles and oral literature in addition to written accounts and traditions about Somalis and Somalia from European explorers and neighbouring regions in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East Since

accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation but is now used to describe seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation associated with the asymmetric heating of land and sea Usually the term monsoon is used to refer to the rainy phase of a pattern although technically there is also a dry phase The major monsoon systems of the world consist of the West African and monsoons The inclusion of the North and South American monsoons with incomplete wind reversal has been debated The term was first used in English in British India now India Bangladesh and Pakistan and neighbouring countries to refer to the big seasonal winds blowing from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area Etymology Uttar Pradesh The English monsoon came from Portuguese mono ultimately from Arabic mawsim season perhaps partly via early modern Dutch monsun The word mausam is also the word for weather in Hindi Urdu and several other North Indian languages History Strengthening of the Asian monsoon has been linked to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau after the collision of the Indian and Asia around 50 million years ago Many geologists believe the monsoon first became strong around million years ago based on records from the Arabian Sea and the record of dust in the Loess Plateau of China More recently plant fossils in China and new sediment records from the South China Sea led to a timing of the monsoon starting 15-20 million years ago and linked to early Tibetan uplift Testing of this hypothesis awaits deep ocean sampling by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program The monsoon has varied significantly in strength since this time largely linked to global climate change especially the cycle of the Pleistocene ice ages Timing of the monsoon strengthening of the Indian Monsoon of around million years ago was suggested due to an interval of closing of the Indonesian Seaway to cold thermocline waters passage from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean which is believed to have resulted in an increased sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean which increased gyral circulation and then caused an increased intensity of the monsoon Five episodes during the Quaternary at 2.22 Ma 1.83 Ma 0.68 Ma 0.45 Ma and 0.04 Ma were identified which showed a weakening of Leeuwin Current LC The weakening of the LC would have an effect on the sea surface temperature SST field in the Indian Ocean as the Indonesian through flow generally warms the Indian Ocean Thus these five intervals could probably be those of considerable lowering of SST in the Indian Ocean and would have influenced Indian monsoon intensity During the weak LC there is the possibility of reduced intensity of the Indian winter monsoon and strong summer monsoon because of change in the Indian Ocean dipole due to reduction in net heat input to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian through flow Thus a better understanding of the possible links between El Nio Western Pacific Warm Pool Indonesian Throughflow wind pattern off western Australia and ice volume expansion and contraction can be obtained by studying the behaviour of the LC during Quaternary at close stratigraphic intervals Process Calcutta Monsoons may be considered as sea breezes due to seasonal heating and the resulting development of a thermal low over a continental landmass They are caused by the larger amplitude of the seasonal cycle of land temperature compared to that of nearby oceans This differential warming happens because heat in the ocean is mixed vertically through a mixed layer that may be fifty metres deep through the action of wind and turbulence whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly with the seasonal signal penetrating perhaps a metre or so Additionally the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly higher than that of most materials that make up land Together these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land with the consequence that the air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than the air over the ocean The hot air over the land tends to rise creating an area of low pressure This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land bringing the moist air over the oceans with it Similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains surface heating convergence at the surface divergence aloft or from outflows at the surface However the lifting occurs the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure which in turn produces condensation In winter the land cools off quickly but the ocean retains heat longer The cold air over the land creates a high pressure area which produces a breeze from land to ocean Most summer monsoons have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air The intensity and duration however are not uniform from year to year Winter monsoons by contrast have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge subside and cause drought Even more broadly it is now understood that in the geological past monsoon systems likely accompanied the formation of supercontinents such as Pangaea with their extreme continental climates Global monsoons Africa The monsoon of western Africa is the result of the seasonal shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the great seasonal temperature and humidity differences between the Sahara and the equatorial Atlantic Ocean It migrates northward from the equatorial Atlantic in February reaches western Africa on June 22 then moves back to the south by October The dry northeasterly trade winds and their more extreme form the harmattan are interrupted by the northern shift in the ITCZ and resultant southerly winds during the summer The semiarid Sahel and Sudan depend upon this pattern for most of their precipitation North America The North American monsoon NAM occurs from late June or early July into September originating over Mexico and spreading into the southwest United States by It affects Mexico along the Sierra Madre Occidental as well as Arizona New Mexico Nevada Utah Colorado West Texas and California It pushes as far west as the Peninsular Ranges and Transverse Ranges of Southern California but rarely reaches the coastal strip a wall of desert thunderstorms only a drive away is a common summer sight from the sunny skies along the coast during the monsoon The North American monsoon is known to many as the Summer Southwest Mexican or Arizona monsoon It is also sometimes called the Desert monsoon as a large part of the affected area are the Mojave and Sonoran deserts Asia The Asian monsoons may be classified into a few such as the South Asian Monsoon which affects the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions and the East Asian Monsoon which affects southern China Korea and parts of Japan South Asian monsoon Southwest monsoon The southwestern summer monsoons occur from June through September The Thar Desert and adjoining areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent heats up considerably during the hot summers which causes a low pressure area over the northern and central Indian subcontinent To fill this void the winds from the Indian Ocean rush in to the subcontinent These winds rich in moisture are drawn towards the Himalayas creating winds blowing storm clouds towards the subcontinent The Himalayas act like a high wall blocking the winds from passing into Central Asia thus forcing them to rise With the gain in altitude of the clouds the temperature drops and precipitation occurs Some areas of the subcontinent receive up to of rain The southwest monsoon is generally expected to begin around the start of June and fade down by the end of September The winds on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula due to its topography become divided into two parts the Arabian Sea Branch and the Bay of Bengal Branch The Arabian Sea Branch of the Southwest Monsoon first hits the Western Ghats of the coastal state of Kerala India thus making the area the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest Monsoon This branch of the monsoon moves northwards along the Western Ghats with precipitation on coastal areas west of the Western Ghats The eastern areas of the Western Ghats do not receive much rain from this monsoon as the wind does not cross the Western Ghats The Bay of Bengal Branch of Southwest Monsoon flows over the Bay of Bengal heading towards India and Bengal picking up more moisture from the Bay of Bengal The winds arrive at the Eastern Himalayas with large amounts of rain Mawsynram situated on the southern slopes of the Eastern Himalayas in Shillong India is one of the wettest places on Earth After the arrival at the Eastern Himalayas the winds turns towards the west travelling over the Plain at a rate of roughly 12 weeks per state pouring rain all along its way June is regarded as the date of onset of the monsoon in India as indicated by the arrival of the monsoon in the southernmost state of Kerala The monsoon accounts for 80 of the rainfall in India Indian agriculture which accounts for 25 of the GDP and employs 70 of the population is heavily dependent on the rains for growing crops especially like cotton rice oilseeds and coarse grains A delay of a few days in the arrival of the monsoon can badly affect the economy as evidenced in the numerous droughts in India in the 1990s The monsoon is widely welcomed and appreciated by as well for it provides relief from the climax of summer heat in June However the condition of the roads take a battering each year Often houses and streets are waterlogged and the slums are flooded in spite of having a drainage system This lack of city infrastructure coupled with changing climate patterns causes severe economical loss including damage to property and loss of lives as evidenced in the 2005 flooding in Mumbai that brought Mumbai to a standstill Bangladesh and certain regions of India like Assam and West Bengal also frequently experience heavy floods during this season And in the recent past areas in India that used to receive scanty rainfall throughout the year like the Thar Desert have surprisingly ended up receiving floods due to the prolonged monsoon season The influence of the Southwest Monsoon is felt as far north as in China Xinjiang It is estimated that about 70 of all precipitation in the central part of the Tian Shan Mountains falls during the three summer months when the region is under the monsoon influence about 70 of that is directly of cyclonic origin as opposed to local convection Northeast monsoon Around September with the sun fast retreating south the northern land mass of the Indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly With this air pressure begins to build over northern India the Indian Ocean and its surrounding atmosphere still holds its heat This causes the cold wind to sweep down from the Himalayas and Plain towards the vast spans of the Indian Ocean south of the Deccan peninsula This is known as the Northeast Monsoon or Retreating Monsoon While travelling towards the Indian Ocean the dry cold wind picks up some moisture from the Bay of Bengal and pours it over peninsular India and parts of Sri Lanka Cities like Madras which get less rain from the Southwest Monsoon receives rain from this Monsoon About 50 to 60 of the rain received by the state of Tamil Nadu is from the Northeast Monsoon In Southern Asia the northeastern monsoons take place from December to early March when the surface system is strongest The jet stream in this region splits into the southern subtropical jet and the polar jet The subtropical flow directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern Asia creating dry air streams which produce clear skies over India Meanwhile a low pressure system develops over Asia and Australasia and winds are directed toward Australia known as a monsoon trough East Asian Monsoon The East Asian monsoon affects large parts of Philippines China Korea and Japan It is characterised by a warm rainy summer monsoon and a cold dry winter monsoon The rain occurs in a concentrated belt that stretches except in East China where it is tilted over Korea and Japan The seasonal rain is known as Meiyu in China Changma in Korea and in Japan with the latter two resembling frontal rain The onset of the summer monsoon is marked by a period of premonsoonal rain over South China and Taiwan in early May From May through August the summer monsoon shifts through a series of dry and rainy phases as the rain belt moves northward beginning over Indochina and the South China Sea May to the Yangtze River Basin and Japan June and finally to North China and Korea July When the monsoon ends in August the rain belt moves back to South China Australia Australia Also known as the Monsoon The rainy season occurs from September to February and it is a major source of energy for the Hadley circulation during boreal winter The Maritime Continent Monsoon and the Australian Monsoon may be considered to be the same system the Monsoon It is associated with the development of the Siberian High and the movement of the heating maxima from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere winds flow down Southeast Asia are turned by Borneo topography towards Australia This forms a cyclonic circulation vortex over Borneo which together with descending cold surges of winter air from higher latitudes cause significant weather phenomena in the region Examples are the formation of a rare tropical storm in 2001 Tropical Storm Vamei and the devastating flood of Jakarta in 2007 The onset of the monsoon over the Maritime Continent tends to follow the heating maxima down Vietnam and the Malay Peninsula September to Sumatra Borneo and the Philippines October to Java Sulawesi November Irian Jaya and Northern Australia December January However the monsoon is not a simple response to heating but a more complex interaction topography wind and sea as demonstrated by its abrupt rather than gradual withdrawal from the region The Australian monsoon or rainy season occurs in the austral summer when the monsoon trough develops over Northern Australia Over of annual rainfall in Northern Australia fall during this time Europe The European Monsoon more commonly known as the Return of the Westerlies is the result of a resurgence of westerly winds from the Atlantic where they become loaded with wind and rain These Westerly winds are a common phenomenon during the European winter but they ease as Spring approaches in late March and through April and May The winds pick up again in June which is why this phenomenon is also referred to as the return of the westerlies The rain usually arrives in two waves at the beginning of June and again in mid to late June The European monsoon is not a monsoon in the traditional sense in that it does meet all the requirements to be classified as such Instead the Return of the Westerlies is more regarded as a conveyor belt that delivers a series of low pressure centres to Western Europe where they create unseasonable weather These storms generally feature significantly lower than average temperatures fierce rain or hail thunder and strong winds The Return of the Westerlies affects Europe Northern Atlantic coastline more precisely Ireland Great Britain the Benelux countries Western Germany Northern France and parts of Scandinavia References Further reading International Committee of the Third Workshop on Monsoons The Global Monsoon System Research

AD 14 is considered the first emperor of the Roman Empire which he ruled alone from 27BC until his death in 14 AD Born Gaius Octavius Thurinus he was adopted by his Gaius Julius Caesar in 44BC via his last will and testament and between then and 27BC was officially named Gaius Julius Caesar In 27BC the Senate awarded him the honorific Augustus the revered one and thus consequently he was Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Because of the various names he bore it is common to call him Octavius when referring to events between 63 and 44BC Octavian or Octavianus when referring to events between 44 and 27BC and Augustus when referring to events after 27BC In Greek sources Augustus is known as or Sebastos depending on context The young Octavius came into his inheritance after Caesar assassination in 44BC In 43BC Octavian joined forces with Mark Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in a military dictatorship known as the Second Triumvirate As a triumvir Octavian ruled Rome and many of its provinces The triumvirate was eventually torn apart under the competing ambitions of its rulers Lepidus was driven into exile and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by the fleet of Octavian commanded by Agrippa in 31BC After the demise of the Second Triumvirate Octavian restored the outward facade of the Roman Republic with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate but in practice retained his autocratic power It took several years to determine the exact framework by which a formally republican state could be led by a sole ruler the result became known as the Roman Empire The emperorship was never an office like the Roman dictatorship which Caesar and Sulla had held before him indeed he declined it when the Roman populace entreated him to take on the dictatorship By law Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate including those of tribune of the plebs and censor He was consul until 23BC His substantive power stemmed from financial success and resources gained in conquest the building of patronage relationships throughout the Empire the loyalty of many military soldiers and veterans the authority of the many honors granted by the Senate Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time Octavius was taken to his father home village at Velletri to be raised Octavius only mentions his father equestrian family briefly in his memoirs His paternal was a military tribune in Sicily during the Second Punic War His grandfather had served in several local political offices His father also named Gaius Octavius had been governor of Macedonia His mother Atia was the niece of Julius Caesar In 59BC when he was four years old his father died His mother married a former governor of Syria Lucius Marcius Philippus Philippus claimed descent from Alexander the Great and was elected consul in 56BC Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius Because of this Octavius was raised by his grandmother and Julius Caesar sister Julia Caesaris In 52 or 51BC Julia Caesaris died Octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother From this point his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him He donned the toga virilis four years later and was elected to the College of Pontiffs in 47BC The following year he was put in charge of the Greek games that were staged in honor of the Temple of Venus Genetrix built by Julius Caesar In 46BC she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania where he planned to fight the forces of Pompey Caesar late enemy but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel When he had recovered he sailed to the front but was shipwrecked after coming ashore with a handful of companions he crossed hostile territory to Caesar camp which impressed his considerably When back in Rome Caesar deposited a new will with the Vestal Virgins naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary Rise to power Heir to Caesar 1867 On 15 March 44BC Octavius adoptive father Julius Caesar was assassinated by a conspiracy led by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus At the time Caesar was killed on the Ides of March the 15th 44BC Octavius was studying and undergoing military training in Apollonia Illyria Rejecting the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia he sailed to Italia to ascertain if he had any potential political fortunes or security After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium he learned the contents of Caesar will and only then did he decide to become Caesar political heir as well as heir to of his estate Having no living legitimate children Caesar had adopted his Octavius as his son and main heir Upon his adoption Octavius assumed his name Gaius Julius Caesar Although Romans who had been adopted into a new family usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius etc there is no evidence that he ever bore the name Octavianus as it would have made his modest origins too obvious However despite the fact that he never officially bore the name Octavianus to save confusing the dead dictator with his heir historians often refer to the new Caesarbetween his adoption and his assumption in 27BC of the name Augustusas Octavian Mark Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours though Suetonius in his work Lives of the Twelve Caesars describes Antony accusation as political slander To make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy Octavian could not rely on his limited funds After a warm welcome by Caesar soldiers at Brundisium A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds made no action against Octavian since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate arch enemy Mark Antony Octavian made another bold move in 44BC when without official permission he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Rome Near Eastern province to Italy Octavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesar veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar On his march to Rome through Italy Octavian presence and newly acquired funds attracted many winning over Caesar former veterans stationed in Campania Arriving in Rome on May 44BC Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar money to him However during the summer he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him or to bear with him during their efforts to get rid of Antonius In September the Optimate orator Marcus Tullius Cicero began to attack Antony in a series of speeches portraying Antony as the greatest threat to the order of the Senate With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end Antony attempted to pass laws which would lend him control over Cisalpine Gaul which had been assigned as part of his province from Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus one of Caesar assassins Octavian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans and on 28 November won over two of Antony legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain In the face of Octavian large and capable force Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome and to the relief of the Senate he fled to Cisalpine Gaul which was to be handed to him on January The resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the violence were rejected by Antony as the Senate had no army of its own to challenge him this provided an opportunity for Octavian who was already known to have armed forces This was in part a rebuttal to Antony opinion of Octavian as Cicero quoted Antony saying to Octavian You boy owe everything to your name In this unlikely alliance orchestrated by the arch senator Cicero the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on January 43BC yet he was also given the power to vote alongside the former consuls In April of 43BC Antony forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul However both consuls were killed leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies After heaping many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than Octavian for defeating Antony the Senate attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus yet Octavian decided not to cooperate Instead Octavian stayed in the Po Valley and refused to aid any further offensive against Antony In July an embassy of centurions sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded that he receive the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa Octavian also demanded that the decree declaring Antony a public enemy should be rescinded Meanwhile Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus another leading Caesarian Second Triumvirate Proscriptions bearing the portraits of Mark Antony left and Octavian right issued in 41BC to celebrate the establishment of the Second Triumvirate by Octavian Antony and Marcus Lepidus in 43BC Both sides bear the inscription III VIR R P C meaning One of Three Men for the Regulation of the Republic In a meeting near Bologna in October of 43BC Octavian Antony and Lepidus formed a junta called the Second Triumvirate The triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions in which allegedly 300 senators and 2,000 equites were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and for those who failed to escape their lives This decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay their troops salaries for the upcoming conflict against Caesar assassins Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was more responsible for the proscriptions and killing However the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies Marcus Velleius Paterculus asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them Suetonius presents the case that Octavian although reluctant at first to proscribe officials nonetheless pursued his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs minted 18BC Obverse CAESAR AVGVSTVS reverse DIVVSIVLIV S DIVINE JULIUS Battle of Philippi and division of territory On January 42BC the Senate posthumously recognized Julius Caesar as a divinity of the Roman state Divus Iulius Octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was Divi filius Son of God Antony and Octavian then sent 28 legions by sea to face the armies of Brutus and Cassius who had built their base of power in Greece After two battles at Philippi in Macedonia in October of 42 the Caesarian army was victorious and Brutus and Cassius committed suicide Mark Antony would later use the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antony forces In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa instead Octavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius who could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased also required land There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions Rebellion and marriage alliances Widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over his soldiers settlements encouraged many to rally at the side of Lucius Antonius who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate However Octavian showed no mercy for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius on 15 March the anniversary of Julius Caesar assassination he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius Perusia was also pillaged and burned as a warning for others Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius who was ironically a member of the republican party not the Caesarian faction Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian Antony left Cleopatra he sailed to Italy in 40BC with a large force to oppose Octavian laying siege to Brundisium However this new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony Their centurions who had become important figures politically refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause while the legions under their command followed suit Meanwhile in Sicyon Antony wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her Fulvia death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation A temporary peace agreement was reached in 39BC with the treaty of Misenum the blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia Corsica Sicily and the Peloponnese and ensured him a future position as consul for 35BC One of Pompeius naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian However Octavian needed Antony additional support to attack Pompeius so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirate extension for another period beginning in 37BC In supporting Octavian Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against Parthia desiring to avenge Rome defeat at Carrhae in 53BC However Octavian sent only a tenth the number of those promised which was viewed by Antony as an intentional provocation Despite setbacks for Octavian the naval fleet of Sextus Pompeius was almost entirely destroyed on September by general Agrippa at the naval battle of Naulochus Both Lepidus and Octavian gathered the surrendered troops of Pompeius yet Lepidus felt empowered enough to claim Sicily for himself ordering Octavian to leave The Roman dominions were now divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East To maintain peace and stability in his portion of the Empire Octavian ensured Rome citizens of their rights to property This time he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy while returning 30,000 slaves to former Roman owners that had previously fled to Pompeius to join his army and navy To ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome Octavian had the Senate grant him his wife and his sister tribunal immunity or sacrosanctitas War with Antony Meanwhile Antony campaign against Parthia turned disastrous tarnishing his image as a leader and the mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces On the other hand Cleopatra could restore his army to full strength and since he was already engaged in a romantic affair with her he decided to send Octavia back to Rome Octavian used this to spread propaganda implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman because he rejected a legitimate Roman spouse for an Oriental paramour In 36BC Octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and Antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end and that he would step down as triumvir if only Antony would do the same Antony refused After Roman troops captured the Kingdom of Armenia in 34BC Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia he also awarded the title Queen of Kings to Cleopatra acts which Octavian used to convince the Roman Senate that Antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of Rome Defecting consuls and senators rushed over to the side of Antony in disbelief of the propaganda which turned out to be true yet so did able ministers desert Antony for Octavian in the autumn of 32BC These defectors Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius gave Octavian the information he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations he made against Antony By storming the sanctuary of the Vestal Virgins Octavian forced their chief priestess to hand over Antony secret will which would have given away territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule alongside plans to build a tomb in Alexandria for him and his queen to reside upon their deaths In late 32BC the Senate officially revoked Antony powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatra regime in Egypt by Lorenzo Castro painted 1672 National Maritime Museum London In early 31BC while Antony and Cleopatra were temporarily stationed in Greece Octavian gained a preliminary victory when the navy under the command of Agrippa successfully ferried troops across the Adriatic Sea While Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatra main force from their supply routes at sea Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra modern Corfu and marched south Antony and his remaining forces were only spared due to a effort by Cleopatra fleet that had been waiting nearby Octavian pursued them and after another defeat in Alexandria on August 30BC Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide Antony fell on his own sword and into Cleopatra arms while she let a venomous snake bite her Having exploited his position as Caesar heir to further his own political career Octavian was only too well aware of the dangers in allowing another to do so and reportedly commenting that two Caesars are one too many he ordered CaesarionJulius Caesar son by Cleopatrato be killed whilst sparing Cleopatra children by Antony with the exception of Antony older son Octavian had previously shown little mercy to military combatants and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the Roman people yet he was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium but would have to achieve this through incremental power gains courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome to appear that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy First settlement Paris In 27 BC Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Roman Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies Although Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike To a large extent the public was aware of the vast financial resources Augustus commanded When he failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy he undertook direct responsibility for them in 20 BC This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC after he donated vast amounts of money to the aerarium Saturni the public treasury The Senate proposed to Octavian the victor of Rome civil wars that he once again assume command of the provinces The senate proposal was a ratification of Octavian power Through the senate Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a constitution Feigning reluctance he accepted a responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic The provinces ceded to him that he might pacify them within the promised period comprised much of the conquered Roman world including all of Hispania and Gaul Syria Cilicia Cyprus and Egypt Moreover command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Rome legions While Octavian acted as consul in Rome he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure his orders were carried out Augustus from the Latin word Augere meaning to increase can be translated as the illustrious one It was a title of religious rather than political authority Princeps comes from the Latin phrase primum caput the first head originally meaning the oldest or most distinguished senator whose name would appear first on the senatorial roster in the case of Augustus it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge Princeps had also been a title under the Republic for those who had served the state well for example Pompey had held the title Augustus also styled himself as Imperator Caesar divi filius Commander Caesar son of the deified one This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a triumph with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat memento mori or Remember you are mortal to the triumphant general Additionally laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic racing and dramatic contests Thus both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of Roman religion and statecraft placing them on Augustus doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital However Augustus renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a scepter wearing a diadem or wearing the golden crown and purple toga of his predecessor Julius Caesar If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the Curia bearing the inscription virtus pietas clementia iustitia valor piety clemency and justice Piso was a well known member of the republican faction and serving as with him was another means by Augustus to show his willingness to make concessions and cooperate with all political parties In the late spring Augustus suffered a severe illness and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would put in doubt the senators suspicions of his Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa Augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs as a system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility amongst the Romans fearful of monarchy on a three layered sardonyx cameo AD 14/20 Soon after his bout of illness subsided Augustus gave up his permanent consulship Although he had resigned as consul Augustus retained his consular imperium leading to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement This was a clever ploy by Augustus by stepping down as one of two consuls this allowed aspiring senators a better chance to fill that position while at the same time Augustus could exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class Earlier as a consul he had the power to intervene when he deemed necessary with the affairs of provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate As a proconsul Augustus did not want this authority of overriding provincial governors to be stripped from him so imperium proconsulare maius or power over all the proconsuls was granted to Augustus by the Senate This allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before it veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate preside over elections and the right to speak first at any meeting Also included in Augustus tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure they were in the public interest as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate With the powers of a censor Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all other attire besides the classic toga while entering the Forum There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state however this position did not extend to the censor ability to hold a census and determine the Senate roster The office of the tribune plebis began to lose its prestige due to Augustus amassing of tribunal powers so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the praetorship Augustus as Pontifex Maximus In addition to tribunician authority Augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome itself all armed forces in the city formerly under the control of the prefects and consuls were now under the sole authority of Augustus With maius imperium proconsulare Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph as he was ostensibly the head of every Roman army In 19BC Lucius Cornelius Balbus governor of Africa and conqueror of the Garamantes was the first man of provincial origin to receive this award as well as the last Ensuring that his status of maius imperium proconsulare was renewed in 13BC Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support In 22BC there was a food shortage in Rome which sparked panic while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis In 19BC the Senate voted to allow Augustus to wear the consul insignia in public and before the Senate Like his tribune authority the granting of consular powers to him was another instance of holding power of offices he did not actually hold On February 2BC Augustus was also given the title pater patriae or father of the country Later Roman Emperors would generally be limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus though often to display humility newly appointed Emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus Just as often as their reign progressed Emperors would appropriate all of the titles regardless of whether they had actually been granted them by the Senate The civic crown which later Emperors took to actually wearing consular insignia and later the purple robes of a Triumphant general toga picta became the imperial insignia well into the Byzantine era War and expansion s however areas under Roman control shown here were subject to change even during Augustus reign especially in Germania Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus chose Imperator victorious commander to be his first name since he wanted to make the notion of victory associated with him emphatically clear By the year 13 Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed imperator as his title after a successful battle a successful military commander under Augustus before he was designated as his heir and successor By the end of his reign the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania modern Spain and Portugal the Alpine regions of Raetia and Noricum modern Switzerland Bavaria Austria Slovenia This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustus future military campaigns as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in Roman mining projects especially the very rich gold deposits at Las Medulas for example The poet Horace dedicated an ode to the victory while the monument Trophy of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12BC when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland Both campaigns were successful as Drusus forces reached the Elbe River by 9BC yet he died shortly after by falling off his horse To ensure security of the Empire eastern flank Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome diplomat to the East Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus defeat by military means However Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue Augustus of Prima Porta and in monuments such as the Temple of Mars Ultor the Avenger built to house the standards Although Parthia always posed a threat to Rome in the east the real battlefront was along the Rhine and Danube rivers Victory in battle was not always a permanent success as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome enemies in Germania Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it which had some success although the battle of AD brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany The Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes they defeated Arminius who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery Death and succession struck under Augustus AD 1314 the reverse shows Tiberius riding on a quadriga celebrating the fifteenth renewal of his tribunal power At least six potential heirs including Agrippa and his sons had expired or proven incapable of succeeding Augustus before he finally settled on Tiberius in AD The illness of Augustus in 23BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public To ensure stability he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government This was to be achieved in small undramatic and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister son Marcellus who had been quickly married to Augustus daughter Julia the Elder Other historians dispute this due to Augustus will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23BC instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa who was Augustus second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together Although this granting of power would have shown Augustus favor for Agrippa it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him He took the consulship in and 2BC so he could personally usher them into their political careers and they were nominated for the consulships of AD and Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons Livia children from her first marriage Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus and Tiberius Claudius granting them military commands and public office and seeming to favor Drusus However Drusus marriage to Antonia Augustus niece was a relationship far too embedded within the family to disturb over succession issues While Drusus marriage to Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair Vipsania was only the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage Although no specific reason is known for his departure it could have been a combination of reasons including a failing marriage with Julia After the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD and respectively and the earlier death of his brother Drusus 9BC Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he in turn adopt his nephew Germanicus This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs The only other possible claimant as heir was Postumus Agrippa who had been exiled by Augustus in AD his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree and Augustus officially disowned him Postumus Agrippa was murdered at his place of exile either shortly before or after the death of Augustus On 19 August AD 14 Augustus died while visiting the place of his father death at Nola and Tiberiuswho was present alongside Livia at Augustus deathbedwas named his heir Augustus famous last words were Have I played the part well Then applaud as I exit referring to the and regal authority that he had put on as emperor Publicly though his last words were Behold I found Rome of clay and leave her to you of marble An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus body from Nola to Rome and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day Augustus body was cremated on a pyre close to his mausoleum It was proclaimed that Augustus joined the company of the gods as a member of the Roman pantheon Shotter suggests that Augustus deification coupled with Tiberius extremely conservative attitude towards religion obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment he might have harbored Also the historian points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it and were inscribed on many public edifices such as the temple in Ankara dubbed the Monumentum Ancyranum called the queen of inscriptions by historian Theodor Mommsen There are a few known written works by Augustus that have survived This includes his poems Sicily Epiphanus and Ajax an autobiography of 13 books a philosophical treatise and his written rebuttal to Brutus Eulogy of Cato However historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by Augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life Many consider Augustus to be Rome greatest emperor his policies certainly extended the Empire life span and initiated the celebrated Pax Romana or Pax Augusta He was intelligent decisive and a shrewd politician but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar and was influenced on occasion by his third wife Livia sometimes for the worse Nevertheless his legacy proved more enduring The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus with Rome first institutionalized police force fire fighting force and the establishment of the municipal prefect as a permanent office With Rome civil wars at an end Augustus was also able to create a standing army for the Roman Empire fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers This was supported by numerous auxiliary units of 500 soldiers each often recruited from recently conquered areas With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy Augustus also installed an official courier system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the praefectus vehiculorum In the year Augustus established the aerarium militare donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers One of the most lasting institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27BC originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome They had the power to intimidate the Senate install new emperors and depose ones they disliked the last emperor they served was Maxentius as it was Constantine I who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks the Castra Praetoria in Nubia Although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess In the year 29BC Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon In 28BC he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest Had Augustus died earlier in 23BC for instance matters might have turned out differently The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus therefore must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years Augustus own experience his patience his tact and his political acumen also played their parts He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor expense Augustus ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor Every emperor of Rome adopted his name Caesar Augustus which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title However for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages The contemporary Roman jurist Marcus Antistius Labeo AD 10/11 fond of the days of republican liberty in which he had been born openly criticized the Augustan regime In the beginning of his Annals the Roman historian Tacitus 56c.117 wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery The 3rd century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign moderate ruler yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus Dio viewed Augustus as an autocrat In his criticism of Augustus the admiral and historian Thomas Gordon 16581741 compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant Oliver Cromwell 15991658 In his Memoirs of the Court of Augustus the Scottish scholar Thomas Blackwell 17011757 deemed Augustus a Machiavellian ruler a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper wicked and worthless a mean spirit and a tyrant The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census with fixed quotas for each province Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces As it was effectively considered Augustus private property rather than a province of the Empire it became part of each succeeding emperor patrimonium Instead of a legate or proconsul Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming Prefect of the Praetorian Guard The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions Building projects Altar of Peace 13BC to BC On his deathbed Augustus boasted I found a Rome of bricks I leave to you one of marble Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this Cassius Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empire strength Marble could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus triumphs in the Res Gestae Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians the Vestals and the citizenry of Rome To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium the Arch of Augustus was built in 29BC near the entrance of the Temple of Castor and Pollux and widened in 19BC to include a design In that year Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome aqueducts did not fall into disrepair The Corinthian order of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model Ancestry Descendants Augustus only child was his daughter Julia Caesaris 39BC AD 14 had five children Gaius Julius Caesar 20BC AD died without issue

Shangla a valley of sorrows is in grip of natural disasters Earthquake Floods Rains and terrorism The spell of heavy rains and floods beginning in the month of July 2010 affected approximately million people in Pakistan It caused death of thousands of people and many more were injured across the country Hundreds of dwelling houses shops roads bridges and other infrastructures were completely washed away by floods This is the biggest natural disaster of history in Pakistan Shangla is an unfortunate valley which also severely affected in recent natural disaster In fact natural resources and beauty is bestowed by God to Shangla valley Due to its scenic beauty ever greenery and fragrant air it is piece of paradise on earth Shangla upgraded to status of district on July 10 1995 by the then chief minister Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao On one hand Shangla valley is gifted with natural beauty while on the other hand Shangla is a backward and tribal society where majority of the people live below the poverty line and are illiterate Its poverty and backwardness can be well estimated from the fact that Shangla district is on top in ratio of poverty in Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa province and on 2nd across the Pakistan Due to negligence of government and its elected representatives Shangla lag behind in the run of development Similarly the natural disasters and calamities had made this valley miserable Since long Shangla is confronted with natural disasters and terrorist activities Shangla has been affected in 1974 by destructive earthquake and in 2004 by the severe snowfall mud sliding and fall of avalanches In October 2005 a powerful and devastating earthquake struck the Shangla caused major destruction and take of lives of thousands peoples The affects of which still existed in the of the people They have not reconstructed their damaged houses yet Similarly the valley remained in grip of terrorist activities since 2007 Fear and fright prevailed among the people due to terrorism Activities and businesses of the people remained suspended due to continuous curfew Thousands of people had to leave their homes and compelled to leave as IDPs The current natural disaster and spell of torrential rains and floods hit this valley severely once again Shangla which was already deprived of basic needs and rights of life the current devastating damages pushed it back almost a 100 years Keeping in view all these calamities Shangla may be named a valley of sorrows In Shangla 168 people lost their lives and hundreds of people suffered from injuries as a result of such natural disaster The torrential rains and flash floods destroyed about 110 communication bridges including main bridges and suspension 500 KM roads including 150 KM main roads and 350 KM link roads 139 hydro power stations including major stations 450 water mills 3233 dwelling houses completely 4514 dwelling houses partially Health units Similarly 51 schools including 27 boys primary schools 21 girls primary schools middle schools girls middle school high schools and 278 water supply schemes have been damaged The floodwater and rain also damaged standing crops on 9603 acre area 1200 acre agricultural land 25 pedestrian streets 89 water sources 25 water tanks oil pump shops vehicles standing trees and timbers The floods also washed away buffalos 934 cows 613 and 840 animal shelters In short the floods completely washed away all resources of income of people of Shangla The severely affected union councils in Shangla are Pirkhana Damori Shahpur Koozkana Ranial Opal Dheri Pirabad and Butial In Shangla major unpleasant incident occurred in village Olandar of Pirkhana Kana where at least 60 people have been died in land sliding The damages of the current floods and rains are much more severe as compared to earthquake of 2005 In 2005 at least it was possible to find the dead body of the person died due to earthquake while the dead bodies have been washed away by the recent floods In earthquake of 2005 houses were destroyed but the goods of the houses were present in the remains The earthquake affected people had a place to sit on the remains or on the surroundings while the floods have completely drained houses its all goods and even its In current disaster if anyone has succeeded to save his life that is only in his dressing He has ran away bare headed and bare footed After 2005 earthquake affected people were able to raise tents in fields surroundings of their destroyed houses but now no field or area is left behind to fix tent to live in Majority of affected people are laying deprived and helpless only on the mercy of God In earthquake of 2005 the roads and bridges were safe while in recent turmoil neither road nor bridge remained safe The peoples are confronted with trouble to get their livelihoods In earthquake of 2005 there was no damage to electric and telecommunication systems while after current flash floods all these things do not exist Mostly maize crop is produced in Shangla and if anyone has maize in their homes but no water mill is existed to tread the maize On one hand this natural disaster has damaged the peoples lives health and wealth on the other hand it has also damaged them mentally The educational institutes affected first by terrorism in the region and now the current natural disaster have once again severely affected the academic activities The children are really confronted with critical situation and need special measurements As Shangla was already in grip of natural disasters such as earthquake of 1974 and 2005 suicide attacks militancy military operations curfews and displacement the current floods proved another severe blow The people of Shangla need special attention of government and nongovernmental organisations In this regard media can play a key role to highlight these problems of people of Shangla

By Sardar Muhammad Qaddafi Disaster manger Email sardarsrsp INTRODUCTION Floods are almost annual events in Pakistan Pakistan has been experiencing floods mainly because of its topography Sind Kabul and swat are three hazard prone rivers and due to climatic and ecological condition Pakistan constantly received flooding every year This is not a matter of concern every year However when floods exceed normal flooding level they take dangerous turns Many times in the history of Pakistan floods took severe and sometimes catastrophic turns In the past Pakistan experienced severe floods in 1973 1992 2006 and 2010 But 2010 flood breaks all past records Latest Government estimates put the number of people directly affected by the floods at 15.4 million and the number continues to rise National Disaster Management Authorities 16 August to establish the degree to which affected populations are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance continue The official death toll has risen to 1,603 with 2,366 people reported as injured Over 1,237,360 houses are now reported to have been either damaged or destroyed Pakistan is one of the most natural countries in the World Natural disasters often result in great losses both in terms of materials and peoples lives Due to its unique conditions Pakistan is one of the most disaster prone countries in the world Four provinces AJK and Gilgit baltastan are vulnerable to one or the other disaster Over 40 of landmass is vulnerable to earthquakes to cyclone 60 to floods and 25 of the Barani land under cultivation is vulnerable to drought 2010 extreme floods results the loss in terms of lives and assets have been incalculable A disaster wipes out the gains achieved in decades of development in the affected area Repeated disasters threaten sustainable development in Pakistan Disasters destroy decades of human effort and investments thereby placing new demands on society for reconstruction and rehabilitation If one adds the losses in countries like Pakistan where most of the property of the people especially in the rural areas remains uninsured the losses are huge The unique setting of the North Himalayas the heavy rainfall weak geological formations accelerated rates of erosion followed by silting and meandering of rivers very high seismicity makes the Northern area one of the most disaster prone regions in the country Considering this and the comparative inaccessibility the North region demands special attention to minimize loss of lives and social private and community losses and to ensure sustainable development Vulnerability to natural disasters combined with vulnerability of the people pose a great challenge to the government machinery 

Disasters in Pakistan Pakistan is confronting series of disasters in recent past 2005 earth quake Hunza land slide air blue crash and 2010 Floods are major disasters These disasters have different type and onset but resulted huge damage to life and property is facing different problems like terrorism political uncertainty which badly affected the government and its institutions capacity NDMA Government of Pakistan after 2005 earth quake establish a authority for disaster management but due to lack of technical knowledge and manpower the authority fail to play its role effectively while coping these disasters there is an urgent need to built the capacity of this authority and also clearly lay down its bylaws and mandate NDMA think that its role is only to regulatory which is totally wrong perception the role of any National disaster management authority all over the world is to regulate coordinate develop systems and train technically manpower for disaster management NDMA fail to trained technical managers for Emergency management the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all aspects of emergencies in particularly preparedness response and rehabilitation Emergency management involves plans structures and arrangements established to engage the normal endeavors of government voluntary and private agencies in a comprehensive and coordinated way to respond to the whole spectrum of emergency needs This is also known as disaster management Disaster management in Pakistan Disaster management is multidimensional field and required technical knowledge to get job done army can not manage disaster army can manage war and law and order the only role army can play in disaster management is that they can respond to post disaster phase for rescue relief and recovery on request but here we misuse army in disaster management which not only kept them away from their original task but also put extra burden on armed forces in spite from the fact that army play a exceilent and efficient role in all national calamities on other hand it also indicate weakness in NDMA which is responsible to provide technical assistance to other government agencies in disaster management But we witness that due to lack of technical knowledge and techniques we suffer maximum damages in term of life and property in Air Blue crash the plane caught by fire for many hours and rescue workers reached the spot in minimum possible time but they fail to control the fire and rescue the victims because they dont have fire fighting knowledge this fire can easily be controlled if they put green bushes on fire which is very effective instrument in absence of water these green bushes are wild and extensively available at crash spot but we let the bodies burn to ashes secondly I also observed the search operation for black box which was also conducted in nonprofessional manners CDA worker and other common people are exploring the area like doges exploring bones outside the butcher shop and official called its search operation which is totally wrong search is purely technical think and done through scientific methods These type of searches must be carried out by train searchers according to search methods triage search or up to down left to right search and with the support of magnetic rods which identified black box and this type of search is called electronic search which is correct and scientific method of search I think that we can safe life of the people if we have trained USAR team for future emergencies DISASTER RESPONSE SYSTEM IN PAKISTAN 

IMPACTS OF 2010 FLASH FLOODING IN GILGIT AND KHOHISTAN Many houses and bridges have been destroyed due to flash flooding and also due to the water accompanied debris which mostly consists of timber logs tree branches and uprooted trees of different sizes The mass of debris has been created by destabilization of slope the sub soil layer and vegetation over the same which is transported by the floodwaters Mountainous watershed systems in northern Pakistan collectively send water to rivers leading downstream areas 

2010 FLOOD IN URBAN AREAS NOSHERA The city of Noshera and few other urban areas of Punjab and Sind located in the flood plain of the swat and Sind Rivers badly destroyed by floodwater associated with heavy rain The urban area is located in the catchments In Noshera city debris flow and flooding caused damages and losses to shops commercial centers and house hold items such as furniture electronic items so on The city transportation system water supply sewerage and drainage systems were also subjected to severe destruction or failure in functioning 

Consequences of poor disaster management 2005 earth quake is fast onset disaster all damages are natural and one can not criticized government or any authority because in fast onset disaster damage to life and property can not be minimized by any mean 2010 flood is slow onset disaster in which damage to life and property is failure of NDMA and government of Pakistan because in slow onset disaster damages can be minimized if a country have system in place like early warning system hazard assessment risk calculation etc Political differences amongst federal and provincial governments leading the Flood 2010 disaster toward complex disaster If government of Pakistan and international community fail to manage or poorly managed 2010 flood disaster then it will resulted dire consequences for Pakistan and rest of the world we calculate the amount of damage magnitude and spread of this disaster there is a immediate need to manage this disaster properly if serious steps will not be taken by Government UN and donor countries the situation will create second disaster which later on change into Complex disaster which not only affect Pakistan but the whole civilized world THE SECOND DISASTER The actual disaster results in a lot of damage to the population in terms of loss of life and property This direct result can be dubbed as the first disaster The impact of the first disaster sends another wave of damage triggered by chain of events relating to the first disaster by means of resulting in indirect damage to people remote from the original disaster This can be called the second disaster For example tsunami had caused loss in terms of life damage to houses etc This is the first disaster This leads to disruption in the trade of fishing industries which suffers massive financial losses The losses suffered by these industries results in lower wages and salaries to those involved in the fishing business These people can not repay their loans resulting in losses to money lenders and so on Such events can also result in higher incidences of Looting robberies civil war heart attacks strokes suicides and homicides This is called second disaster and can be in greater magnitude than the first disaster Proper rehabilitation and care of the victims of first disaster can break the chain of events leading to the second disaster Complex Complex disasters exist where adverse political conditions compound a disaster or emergency situation Such situations are complicated because the breakdown of the political structure makes assistance or intervention difficult This sort of emergency is usually associated with the problems of displaced people during times of civil conflict or with people in need caught in areas of conflict NDMA must prepare national disaster plan for flood victims to avoid above stated situations and also centralized all disaster management activities for effective recovery at national level and setup national early warning system Hazard assessment and Risk and hazard mapping for minimizing damages in any future event Apart from an effective disaster response system it is important to have good flood prevention and mitigation system because prevention is better than treatment 

Who is Responsible for damages 2010 floods are historical in term of magnitude and spread out Pakistan is exposed to floods almost every year but the recent floods breaks all records of the past If we put bird eye view on and affected area we see that amount of damage is maximum in term of property and livelihood If we calculate damages first of all food basket of the country completely destroyed loss of livelihood loss of infrastructure These damages can not be recovered or rehabilitated in short period of time by any mean these damages are irrecoverable and irreversible The soil of fertile basin plate of Indus River badly polluted and overlapped by flood salty mud which can not be removed shortly this type of damage can create drought in country 2010 floods are Riverine floods only northern area receive flash flood in flash floods damages are natural because its onset is rapid and give little time for preparedness and its velocity is higher caused damages but most of Pakistan is hit by Riverine flood which gives time and also low velocity caused less damage but due to lack of systems and management this flooding caused maximum damage to country Maximum damages in Riverine flood indicated that we are lacking in technical management of floods which destroyed not only past development but we can not recovered from these damages in coming decade of Pakistan must take serious steps to develop appropriate systems against flood to reduce or minimize future damages Governments of Pakistan is responsible for Immoveable property and livelihood damages As a disaster manager I agree from the fact that in floods damages to immoveable property can not be minimized by any mean but we can minimize the risk of a potential hazard in pre flood period through proper system and technology Past and present Governments of Pakistan are responsible to Irrecoverable Damage to food basket of Indus basin plate of Pakistan because this damage can be minimized if government of Pakistan built Dams which is best instrument of flood control Sind river is biggest in water flow but its water never ever generate floods because of Terbela dam which capacitated large amount of water and utilized for energy and irrigation purposes in spite from the fact that sind river have large potential of flood creation Swat and kabal rivers generated flood because there water is unchecked or free in flow technically both rivers must have dams for control over its water and flow but due to lack of technical knowledge mindless politics and poor planning of government of Pakistan and its concern institutions which not only push the country in darkness butt also destroyed its only god gifted agriculture resource NDMA is responsible for damages to Life and moveable property In disaster manger eyes NDMA is responsible for damages to life and immoveable property Because flood is slow onset disaster not a fast onset disaster which give enough time to Authorities for preparation and mitigation if NDMA have national disaster management strategy in place which includes countrywide early warning system emergency management plan Hydro meteorological hazards assessment Structural measures Environmental impact assessment Environmental degradation assessment Forecast damages can be minimized but due to lack of technical management and preplanning the whole country exposed to floods resulted damages to life and property of people on the other hand government and army also faced hard time in rescue and relief due to sudden occurrence This poor management of flood raises questions in mind of international community that Pakistan suffers huge damages to life and property in slow onset disaster due to mismanagement People of Pakistan are already suffering from poverty and energy crisis now lost their bread and butter a disaster manager we know that the impact of flood disaster is more destructive then earth quake In earth quake damages are bi end while in floods damages are end life and property only property In earth quake people last there life in floods people losses their livelihood and property so they demanded more resources and compensation and disaster of this nature need much resources and money for rehabilitation as compare to earth quake because population remain same and resources reduced FLOOD READY GET SET GO 

To minimize flood damage the basic approach is to prevent flood waters from reaching the damage vulnerable centers The Flood Forecasting Network sends information to all the major flood prone river basins in the country Information from satellites is used for mapping and monitoring flood prone areas The Flood commissioner under the Ministry of Water issues flood forecasts and Warnings A flood alert is issued well in advance of the actual arrival of floods to enable People to take appropriate measures and shift to safer places Despite this floods continue to be a menace primarily because of the huge quantum of silt which has raised the bed level in many rivers During high floods many breaches occur causing inundation over vast areas for most of the monsoon months of June to September The country thus needs a better and effective flood mitigation system to ensure the safety of its people and economy 

VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF FLOOD Almost everyone in the population is affected by a disaster No one is untouched by it Those who suffer damage are called victims The victims may die or live Those who manage to live are called survivors These survivors can be classified as Primary survivor One who is exposed to the disaster and then survives They are called survivor victims Secondary survivor One who grieves the loss of primary victims Example a mother who lost her child or a man who lost his friend Third level survivor The rescue and relief personnel These people are also affected due to the disaster as they are at the site of disaster and undergo almost the same mental trauma as the other victims Fourth level survivor Reporters Government personnel traders etc Fifth level survivor People who read about or see the event in media reports PSYCHO SOCIAL ASPECTS OF FLOOD VICTIMS There is a phenomenal increase in the incidence of psychiatric disorders in the Flood affected population The common problems include Acute stress disorder Post traumatic stress disorder Anxiety disorders Depression Alcohol and drug abuse Diseases Skin diseases Waterborne diseases Gastro etc Potential Flood Hazard in Pakistan I think that we have manpower and instrument but due to lack of technical knowledge we suffer damages in disasters Flood mitigation is not difficult task it can be managed properly through flood mitigation system In Pakistan we have Four potential Flood Hazard Monsoon rains Northern glaciers Dams and Indian controlled rivers Monsoon Rains Firstly the country is more commonly exposed and vulnerable to monsoon rains which are predictable and come periodically With modern satellite weather forecast we can take affective measures to minimize its damages because in floods only immovable property and crops are vulnerable and people livestock and moveable property can be saved but here we suffer maximum damages in flood and turn whole country in to disaster we must have early warning system which can inform vulnerable community about hazard secondly we must have Hazard assessment like amount of water in rivers river delta capacity and the water spread area forecast through which these damages can be minimized Terbela Mangla dams Second potential hazards are Terbela Mangla dams which due to any sudden event can create Flood disaster for this type of hazard we must educate those people whose are vulnerable in downstream area about risk and hazard Everybody must have boat or tire tubes according to house hold size this type of risk reduction tools save life of people 

Third Northern glaciers Melting of glaciers in northern Pakistan due to global warming is also potential hazard this hazard can generate flood in Pakistan can reduce its affect by constructing Dam in northern area Fourth Indian controlled Rivers Pakistan shared western rivers with India and these rivers are developing from India and at any time can generate flooding in Pakistan Factors behind flood in Pakistan Environmental degradation Environmental degradation is major factor behind floods in Pakistan Some examples land degradation deforestation desertification wild land fires loss of biodiversity land water and air pollution climate change sea level rise and ozone depletion EIA is a policy making tool that serves to provide evidence and analysis of environmental impacts of activities from conception to It is utilized extensively in national programming and for international development assistance projects An EIA must include a detailed risk assessment and provide alternatives solutions or options The reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives and needs Potential effects are varied and may contribute to an increase in vulnerability and the frequency and intensity of natural hazards Effects of deforestation there are a number of adverse effects of deforestation such as 

Flooding and Drought One of the vital functions of forests is to absorb and store great amounts of water quickly when there are heavy rains When forests are cut down this regulation of the flow of water is disrupted which leads to alternating periods of flood and then drought in the affected area Global warming Global warming is an other major factor of floods in Pakistan Developed industrial states and wild fires contributing major share in global warming which resulted heavy and long spell rains melting of snow raise in sea level storms and floods in my view moon soon rains are annually fall but this time the unpredictable increase in rain fall is due to global warming resulted flood in Pakistan recent wild fire in Russia resulted heavy and large scale rains in Pakistan resulted flood Climate Change It is well known that global warming is being caused largely due to emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere However what is not known quite as well is that deforestation has a direction association with carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere Trees act as a major storage depot for carbon since they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which is then used to produce carbohydrates fats and proteins that make up trees When deforestation occurs many of the trees are burnt or they are allowed to rot which results in releasing the carbon that is stored in them as carbon dioxide This in turn leads to greater concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere Change in all above stated condition resulted Flooding swat and northern area was richer in forest but due to lack of knowledge and information amongst local people about importance of these natural forest caused serious consequences for them and rest of the country in shape of floods 

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON THE FLOOD FORMATION PROCESS A variety of climatic and processes influence flood processes resulting in river floods flash floods urban floods glacial lake outburst floods and coastal floods Flood magnitude depends on precipitation intensity volume timing and phase Antecedent conditions of rivers and the drainage basins frozen or not or saturated soil moisture or unsaturated and status A number of climatological parameters that are likely to be affected by climate change are precipitation wind storms storm surges sea level rise RAINFALL INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY With the projected future warming there will be changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation and in the hydrologic cycle leading to altered patterns of precipitation and The most likely will be an increase in global average precipitation and evaporation as a direct consequence of warmer temperatures An increase in global average precipitation does not mean that it will get wetter everywhere and in all seasons In fact all climate model simulations show complex patterns of precipitation change with some regions receiving less and others receiving more precipitation than they do now changes in circulation patterns will be critically important in determining changes in local and regional precipitation patterns Precipitation levels are likely to change but could increase or decrease depending on the region Increase in precipitation at high latitudes both in winter and summer seasons are highly consistent across all models Precipitation increase in some monsoon regimes are notable while not consistent considerable agreement is found at broader scale in tropics Heavy precipitation events are likely to increase Intensity of precipitation events is projected to increase particularly in tropics and high latitude areas that experience an increase in mean precipitation In most tropical and and latitude areas extreme precipitation increases more than mean precipitation Evaporation will increase with warming because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and higher temperatures increase the evaporation 23 High or concentrated rainfall could lead to flooding Low rainfalls lead to water scarcity and increased risk of drought This could destroy natural biodiversity and make current agricultural practices unsustainable FLOODS Flood has always been a annual phenomenon in Pakistan According to the MET department Government of Pakistan around 75 of the total rainfall is concentrated over months of monsoon June September and as a result almost all the rivers carry heavy discharge during these four The most flood prone area is the Indus basins The whole country is vulnerable to floods including Gilgit Baltastan KPK Punjab Sind Baluchistan and AJK But recent 2010 floods breaks all past records A flood is a situation in which water temporarily covers land where it normally doesnt This water comes from the sea lakes rivers canals or sewers It can also be rainwater Floods can be described according to speed flash flood geography or cause of flooding Floods are among the most common and destructive natural hazards causing extensive damage to infrastructure public and private services the environment the economy and devastation to human settlements Recurring flood losses have handicapped the economic development of both developed and developing countries Floods usually are local events that can happen suddenly and sometimes with little or no warning They usually are caused by intense storms that produce more runoff than an area can store or a stream can carry within its normal channel Rivers can also flood its surroundings when the dams fail when ice or a landslide temporarily block the course of the river channel or when snow melts rapidly In a broader sense normally dry lands can be flooded by high lake levels by high tides or by waves driven ashore by strong winds Small streams are subject to floods very rapid increases in runoff which may last from a few minutes to a few hours On larger streams floods usually last from several hours to a few days A series of storms might keep a river above flood stage the water level at which a river overflows its banks for several weeks 

A flood is the submerging with water of a normally dry area Floods are caused by many things including rainstorms slow water earthquakes broken dams underwater volcanic eruptions and tsunamis or hurricanes When it floods water has the ability to kill In fact most floods cause a lot of damage because they happen so unexpectedly Prediction Orbiting satellites were originally sent up to help predict weather Since their creation they have been invaluable in forecasting flash floods Because they orbit miles above the earth they can send images of clouds back to earth each half hour These pictures are studied by scientists who look for changes in cloud growth and temperatures to find the possibility of heavy rains Weather satellites gather information that is used to predict strong thunderstorms hurricanes and flash floods Computers are then used to predict the effects of heavy rains Preparation Before Learn CPR and first aid Attend community meetings and discuss what to do in the event of a flood Find out if you live on a flood plain Try not to build on the flood plain If you live in a area contact your insurance agent get flood insurance and document your possessions Ask the National Flood Insurance Program if your home qualifies for insurance Store water supplies in bathtubs plastic bottles and other containers Store rubber boots and gloves Have sandbags plywood plastic sheeting and other lumber handy Sandbags can be used to keep rivers from overflowing and divert flood water The wood can be used to board up windows doors and keep water from flowing into homes Put away toxic substances including propane tanks gasoline cans propane camp stoves spray paint and motor oil Keep supplies of extra food especially food that does not require cooking Keep a potable radio and flashlights with fresh batteries Lay out an emergency evacuation plan knowing the procedure and what items to take with you Try designating more than one escape plan Know the way to higher ground and whether it will be high enough in the event of a flood Place a map in both your car and an emergency supply kit Keep your car gassed If you have a boat keep it ready and supplied with equipment and food Listen for flood warnings and news updates During If you hear the words flood forecast on the news know that heavy rains could cause overflowing river If you hear the words flood warning realize that flooding will happen now or very soon If you hear flash flood warning that means certain areas are expecting or experiencing sudden floods Turn off all utilities Be prepared to evacuate If necessary flee to higher ground If you are driving stay away from storm drains and irrigation ditches Never go past a police blockade areas are usually and dangerous to citizens Keep the radio on for further instructions If your car wont start and water is rising leave the vehicle and find higher ground Place sandbags around your house as instructed If you see a flood coming dont hesitate to evacuate After Check for injuries and help the wounded if necessary If you need additional help call local government Listen for news updates on what to do Avoid flooded areas Be cautious when handling animals Prevention 

Today there are many ways to help prevent and control floods dams have been constructed throughout history across rivers Dikes and levees are built alongside rivers to keep them from overflowing during periods of high water Canals are also used to help drain off extra water Streams and rivers can be diverted to avoid highly populated areas Regulation of floodplain development and urbanization would reduce flood losses Prevention of soil erosion also helps control flooding which is why its a good idea to plant lots of trees treats slopes and grads and creates reservoirs to catch sediment and debris 

RIVER HEIGHT Level The River at a Particular reference point is about 40 full Level The River at a particular reference point is about 60 full Level 10 The River at a particular reference point is 100 full Effects of Flood Primary effects Physical damage Can damage any type of structure including bridges cars buildings sewer systems roadways and canals Casualties People and livestock die due to drowning It can also lead to epidemics and waterborne diseases Secondary effects Water supplies Contamination of water Clean drinking water becomes scarce Diseases Unhygienic conditions Spread of diseases Crops and food supplies Shortage of food crops can be caused due to loss of entire harvest However lowlands near rivers depend upon river silt deposited by floods in order to add nutrients to the local soil Trees species can die from suffocation effects Economic Economic hardship due to temporary decline in tourism rebuilding costs food shortage leading to price increase etc 

Flash floods Flash floods are rapid onset floods that occur 6-12 hours or less after the associated rainfall Flash floods occur particularly in mountainous or hilly area with rather steep terrain gradients and high surface runoff They can also be triggered by the failure of hydraulic infrastructure such as dams or levees outburst of glacier lakes or Due to the short lead time for advance preparation warning and evacuation etc the losses of human life can be substantial Due to the force of rapidly flowing water they pose serious threats to the structural integrity of buildings and infrastructure Depending on depth and velocity of the water as well as the load of debris the water transports the destructive forces are varying Another issue of flash floods relates to the difficulties with predicting the phenomenon and with the short warning lead times In matter of damages this means there is less time for preparatory action so that potential losses are closer to actual losses than with other flood types 

Riverine flooding Riverine flooding can extend over large areas in the mid and lower reaches of a river system where terrain gradients are lower Structural failure of buildings in these reaches is less common due to the lower flow velocities however prolonged inundation may result in foundation failures particularly if the construction is old or not to standard Locally and especially where levees fail the flow velocities are higher however not of the same significance for the loss assessment process as for flash flood 

Coastal flooding Coastal flooding is in most cases induced by storm surges or as a combination between storm surge high tide and elevated levels of river discharge leading to backwater effects in the river delta areas Tsunamis as sources of coastal flooding are a less frequent phenomenon 

Groundwater flooding Groundwater flooding occurs as a result of water rising up from the underlying rocks or from water flowing from abnormal springs This tends to occur after longer periods of sustained high rainfall Higher rainfall means more water will infiltrate into the ground and cause the water table to rise above normal levels Groundwater flooding is most likely to occur in areas underlain by permeable rocks aquifers These may be extensive regional aquifers such as chalk or sandstone or may be localised sands or river gravels in valley bottoms underlain by less permeable rocks Groundwater flooding takes longer to dissipate because groundwater moves much more slowly than surface water and will take time to flow away underground Catastrophic Caused by a significant and unexpected event dam breakage or as a result of another hazard earthquake or volcanic eruption 

Muddy A muddy flood is generated by run off on crop land A muddy flood is produced by an accumulation of runoff generated on cropland Sediments are then detached by runoff and carried as suspended matter or bed load Muddy runoff is more likely detected when it reaches inhabited areas Muddy floods are therefore a hill slope process and confusion with mudflows produced by mass movements should be avoided Other Floods can occur if water accumulates across an impermeable surface from rainfall and can not rapidly dissipate gentle orientation or low evaporation A series of storms moving over the same area 

Direct losses Those losses resulting from direct contact with flood water to buildings and infrastructure Indirect losses Losses resulting from the event but not from its direct impact for example transport disruption business losses that cant be made up losses of family income etc in both loss categories there are two clear of loss Tangible losses Loss of things that have a monetary replacement value for example buildings livestock infrastructure etc Intangible losses Loss of things that can not be bought and sold for example lives and injuries heritage items memorabilia 

RAPID ASSESSMENT DURING THE FLOOD The purpose of assessment during a flood is mainly to have a factual basis for emergency response and relief coordination Emphasis of actions during this phase would rather be on having a basis for avoiding further losses of life for minimizing misery and suffering of the affected population and for avoiding effects secondary disasters Importantly a flood assessment during this phase is also the basis for deciding which levels of administration are to be invoked for the response if local or regional emergency response forces are in the position to contain the situation or if assistance from the national level is necessary It also provides indications for international emergency relief agencies about the possibly needed response from the side of the international community Assessment at this stage will need to be made with very limited time and locally available assets as well as under unsettled circumstances Based on the emphasis of action essential information for the emergency response at this stage would include I People killed displaced or affected by flooding including specified needs for the humanitarian response II Assets that have been flooded inundation map search and rescue and evacuation requirements III People and assets at risk of being flooded further hazard or risk map based on the status of flood defenses and needs for further evacuations IV IV Status of lifelines roads hospitals electricity grid water and food supply hospitals and shelters Current and expected river water levels at various locations as well as weather conditions As such the focus of assessment during this phase is placed on emergency response rather than loss assessment The current Tool does not include a detailed discussion on this topic Further guidance on this issue is available from various sources especially national and international bodies working on emergency response and relief coordination EARLY RECOVERY ASSESSMENT In the immediate aftermath of a flood event weeks after the flood peak the purpose of an early recovery assessment lies in guiding the recovery process and in providing early indications for reconstruction in particular with a view to facilitate the design of financial mechanisms for speedy recovery who will bear the cost lay the foundation for priority setting in allocation of recovery assets provide indications on the coping capacity of the government to repair key infrastructure such as important road links and flood defenses to with stand the next flood provide early indications on mistakes that have been made in past planning and development practice that need to be borne in mind for reconstruction planning The focus of assessment at this stage is necessarily on tangible and direct losses as most the of the intangibles need longer times to be assessed and the indirect losses may not yet be fully apparent or might not have fully materialized yet Especially concerning indirect losses to trade and industry may at this stage not be fully apparent and loss assessments may need to be based on best estimates of affected businesses ASSESSMENT TO MONTHS AFTER THE FLOOD An assessment of the full economic impact of a flood event can only be reliably conducted some 3-6 months after the event Perhaps the best time conduct an assessment of flood losses is after months as most losses including indirect and intangible losses can be assessed with sufficient reliability At this stage a flood loss assessment needs to guide reconstruction planning as well as future flood management policy adjustments At this stage the process may receive a number of data collected in the earlier phases ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT The intention of economic analysis as part of a flood loss assessment is to assess the deviation from likely economic activity as a result of the flood not to take into account the financial losses to individual enterprises This is not always easy to do and you will commonly have to make approximations to this ideal Financial assessment is concerned with the question of how many losses an individual business property or household has had due to flooding The difference becomes clear when looking into an example where say a food production facility has suffered income losses as it was not able to transport its goods to its customers due to blocked roads from flooding However another competitor was able to substitute the goods from its own stock and therefore had an increased income as an indirect effect of the flood Therefore this incidence would not affect the economic impact of the flood 

However all floods are not alike Some floods develop slowly sometimes over a period of days But flash floods can develop quickly sometimes in just a few minutes and without any visible signs of rain Flash floods often have a dangerous wall of roaring water that carries rocks mud and other debris and can sweep away most things in its path Overland flooding occurs outside a defined river or stream such as when a levee is breached but still can be destructive Flooding can also occur when a dam breaks producing effects similar to flash floods 

Measures for flood mitigation Measures The common measures and tools for floodplain management are to modify human susceptibility to flood damage and disruption modify the impact of flooding on individuals and the community modify flooding preserve and restore natural resource regulations and Further focus on measures reduce or avoid flood damage without significantly altering the nature or extent of flooding 

Modifying human susceptibility to flood damage and disruption usually includes floodplain regulations codes and zoning development and redevelopment policies disaster preparedness disaster assistance flood proofing flood forecasting and warning system and emergency plans linking evacuation and warning and preservation of natural resources measures usually include elevation relocation barriers dry flood proofing wet flood proofing buyout and acquisition Preserving and restoring the natural resources and functions of floodplains includes floodplain wetland regulations development and redevelopment policies land acquisition and open space relocation restoration habitat preservation location of service utilities information and education tax adjustments administrative measures beach nourishment and dune building Modifying flooding refers to the more traditional structural approaches such as dams and reservoirs dikes levees and flood walls channel alterations diversions land treatment detention shoreline protection and special grasses Modifying the impact of flooding includes information and education flood insurance tax adjustments flood emergency measures and recovery Watershed Management 

The water storage effect of vegetation soil shallow groundwater wetlands and drainage as a direct impact on the flood level in downstream areas Each of these storage retain certain quantities of water for various periods of time and can influence the timing of tributary flows and hence their contribution to a flood event The storage effect can be likened to a sponge and is dependent on the antecedent conditions and the magnitude of the flood The impacts of changes on flood events can be both positive and negative so predictions are hard to make for a specific watershed Generally the removal of forest and other natural cover and the conversion of land to agricultural uses compacts the soil and reduces infiltration rates leading to higher flood peaks Deforestation is believed to have been a significant cause of the catastrophic flooding in the Indus River Deforestation and other practices can also lead to greater incidences of landslides and mud flows Natural water storage is also generally reduced due to the gradual loss of organic material and soil erosion once an area is converted to agriculture Additionally natural vegetation may transpire moisture to the atmosphere at a greater rate than replacement crops thereby affecting both the amount of storage available in the soil and the amount of local rainfall Drainage of wetlands and marshes contributes directly to changes in the timing of runoff the amount of natural storage in the basin and the vulnerability of the channel to the erosive forces of water 

Basin wide planning Reduction of flood losses must be considered using the basin as the basic planning unit It is absolutely essential to have knowledge of water uses diversions storage and management practices in all parts of the basin as well as the antecedent present and forecasted meteorological and hydrological conditions Trans boundary basins represent a special challenge in that international collaboration is required In such cases consideration should be given to expanding existing bilateral or regional arrangements for exchange of data and information and to the negotiation of treaties or agreements Agreements can also include the option of projects of mutual advantage funded by all the countries involved including construction of flood storage or other flood preventative measures at the most advantageous locations in the basin as a whole 

Development of Policies Strategies and Plans The development of policies strategies and plans to combat the risks associated with natural disasters should be based on a comprehensive risk assessment This requires an integrated approach whereby a wide range of mitigation measures should be considered For example mitigation activities such as hazardous land mapping flood plain mapping plus landslide and areas should be designed so that considerations of other disaster types lead to sounder overall land use plans In essence there would be very little purpose in moving people and goods from one risk zone to another especially if the other hazard is equally or more apt to occur under the prevailing conditions such as torrential rain Within this overall process full consideration needs to be given to the social environmental and economic impacts of policy and programme development This chapter provides guidance on aspects of flood hazards that need to be considered within the overall planning process The aspects contained herein are meant to complement other materials in this guide such as the development of a flow forecasting and warning system which are important tools within the range of options to be considered Basin wide planning Reduction of flood losses must be considered using the basin as the basic planning unit It is absolutely essential to have knowledge of water uses diversions storage and management practices in all parts of the basin as well as the antecedent present and forecasted meteorological and hydrological conditions Evacuation Plan Though it is not possible to control the flood disaster totally by adopting suitable structural and measures the flood damages can be minimized For planning any flood management measure latest reliable accurate and timely information is required In this context satellite remote sensing plays an important role Rescue Evacuation Evacuation is a move to protect life and property where as rescue is a phenomenon of helping people to move from areas that have been hit by disaster to a safer place However the situation of evacuation and rescue comes along with numerous unanswered queries in mind Very often due to lack of information or in haste living during evacuation and rescue becomes difficult and painful However during such the situations following precautionary norms should be kept in mind Preparing for a Flood Here are some basic steps to take to prepare for the flood Contact the local geologist or town planning department or meteorology department to find out if your home is located in a area or area Learn about your community emergency plans warning signals evacuation routes and locations of emergency shelters Plan and practice a flood evacuation route with your family Ask an relative or friend to be the family contact in case your family is separated during a flood Make sure everyone in your family knows the name address and phone number of this contact person Post emergency phone numbers at every phone Inform local authorities about any special needs elderly or bedridden people or anyone with a disability Identify potential home hazards and know how to secure or protect them before the flood strikes Be prepared to turn off electrical power when there is standing water fallen power lines etc Turn off gas and water supplies before you evacuate Secure structurally unstable building materials Buy a fire extinguisher and make sure your family knows where it is and how to use it Buy and install sump pumps with power For drains toilets and other sewer connections install backflow valves or plugs to prevent floodwaters from entering Anchor fuel tanks which can contaminate your basement if torn free An unanchored tank outside can be swept downstream and damage other houses If you are under a flood watch or warning Gather the emergency supplies you previously stocked in your home and stay tuned to local radio or television station for updates Turn off all utilities at the main power switch and close the main gas valve if evacuation appears necessary Have your immunization records handy or be aware of your last tetanus shot in case you should receive a puncture wound or a wound becomes contaminated during or after the flood Fill bathtubs sinks and plastic soda bottles with clean water Sanitize the sinks and tubs first by using bleach Rinse and fill with clean water Bring outdoor possessions such as lawn furniture grills and trash cans inside or tie them down securely Emergency Supplies You Will Need You should stock your home with supplies that may be needed during the emergency period At a minimum these supplies should include Several clean containers for water large enough for a 3-5 day supply of water about five gallons for each person A 3-5 day supply of food and a can opener A first aid kit and manual and prescription medicines and special medical needs A radio flashlights and extra batteries Sleeping bags or extra blankets supplies such as chlorine or iodine tablets or unscented ordinary household chlorine bleach Baby food prepared formula diapers and other baby supplies Disposable cleaning cloths such as baby wipes for the whole family to use in case bathing facilities are not available Personal hygiene supplies such as soap toothpaste sanitary napkins etc An emergency kit for your car with food flares booster cables maps tools a first aid kit fire extinguisher sleeping bags etc Rubber boots sturdy shoes and waterproof gloves Insect repellent containing DEET screens or and clothing for protection from mosquitoes which may gather in pooled water remaining after the flood Preparing to Evacuate Expect the need to evacuate and prepare for it When a flood warning is issued you should Fill your vehicle gas tank and make sure the emergency kit for your car is ready If no vehicle is available make arrangements with friends or family for transportation Fill your clean water containers Review your emergency plans and supplies checking to see if any items are missing Tune in the radio or television for weather updates Listen for disaster sirens and warning signals Put livestock and family pets in a safe area Due to food and sanitation requirements emergency shelters can not accept animals Adjust the thermostat on refrigerators and freezers to the coolest possible temperature If You Are Ordered to Evacuate You should never ignore an evacuation order Authorities will direct you to leave if you are in a area or within the greatest potential path of the rising waters If a flood warning is issued for your area or you are directed by authorities to evacuate the area follow the below mentioned checklists Take only essential items with you If you have time turn off the gas electricity and water Disconnect appliances to prevent electrical shock when power is restored Follow the designated evacuation routes and expect heavy traffic Do not attempt to drive or walk across creeks or flooded roads If You Are Ordered NOT to Evacuate To get through the storm in the safest possible manner Monitor the radio or television for weather updates Prepare to evacuate to a shelter or to a neighbors home if your home is damaged or if you are instructed to do so by emergency personnel 

Before flooding occurs Know the route to the nearest safe shelters that you area aware off Keep the First Aid Kit ready with extra medication for snake bite and diarrhea Strong ropes for tying things A radio torch and spare batteries Stocks of fresh water dry food candles matchbox kerosene etc Umbrellas and bamboo sticks to protect from snakes Higher ground where people and animals can take shelter When you hear a flood warning Tune in to your radio or watch for warning and advice Keep vigil of flood warning given by local authorities Keep dry food and drinking water and warm clothes ready Check your emergency kit If you need to evacuate Pack clothing essential medication valuables personal papers etc in water proof bags to be taken to the safe shelter Raise furniture appliances on beds and tables Put sandbags in the toilet bowl and cover all drain holes to prevent sewage back flow Do not get into water of unknown depth and current Lock your house and take the recommended or known evacuation routes for your area of safe shelter During Floods Drink boiled water or use halogen tablet to purify water before drinking Keep your food covered Do not let children remain on empty stomach Use bleaching powder and lime to disinfect the surroundings Avoid entering flood waters If you need to enter then were proper foot wear Stay away from water over knee level 

Flood resilience measures include Use of concrete floors rather than timber Location of boilers and electrical above the possible flood level No chipboard or MDF instead using plastic and metal alternatives and Lime plaster or cement render rather than conventional gypsum plaster Retrofitting flooded properties during the repair procedure with these is common practice These measures are not necessarily more expensive than conventional techniques but will significantly reduce the damage cost and time to repair if properties are flooded 

Future Proofing It is important that new developments particularly in the higher flood risk zones are future proofed against uncertainty Therefore it is advised that proposed flood mitigation measures associated with developments are reviewed at the detailed FRA stage paying attention to the potential implications of future changes in climate and land use The application of the precautionary principle and the provision of freeboard and flood resistance and resilience in buildings can mitigate future increases in flood risk at relatively low cost at the design and construction stage Other Measures Measures to mitigate the risks of flooding both to and from development are not necessarily limited to those above Depending on the specific risks relating to a site the following investigations options may need further consideration at the detailed FRA stage of development planning Flood resistance resilience measures specific to the potential for groundwater flooding Management of surface runoff entering the site from upslope areas as part of the developments drainage strategy Maintenance improvement of watercourses culverts drain and sewerage networks to reduce associated flood risks 

Do return home until authorities express it is safe to do so Help neighbors whom may need assistance Use extreme caution when entering buildings Inspect foundations for cracks or other damage and examine walls floors doors and windows to make sure that the building is not in danger of collapsing Watch out for animals especially poisonous snakes that may have come into your home with flood waters Watch for loose plaster and ceilings that could fall Take pictures of damage for insurance claims Look for fire hazards Throw away all food including canned that has come in contact with flood waters Pump out flooded basements gradually 1/3 amount of water per day to avoid structural damage Service damaged septic tanks cesspools pits and leaching systems ASAP damaged sewage systems are health hazards 

Flood Plain Management Management of activities within the flood prone area can significantly reduce flood damages to existing development and prevent the amount of damages from rising in the future The most desirable approach is to prohibit new development in the flood plain and to flood proof existing structures or to replace the existing development by alternative usage of the land However where the amount of present development is substantial or the flood plain is essential for the production of food or other key economic activities alternate strategies such as flood and protection can be considered A Structural Measures Construction of Construction of protective works such as flood storage reservoirs diversion of water to side channel storage or other watersheds construction of storm channels to carry water around the area to be protected and levees along the floodway provide tools to reduce flood damages Such works can be constructed to various levels of protection usually based on minimum standards for flood protection the optimum level of costs and benefits based on an economic to meet established levels of acceptable risk Protective works should be considered when major infrastructure has already been developed and costs to protect existing investments are far less than those related to reconstruction lost economic activity disaster assistance or relocation of existing structures and activities However it must be recognized that at some point in the future the design event will likely be exceeded and catastrophic damages will result Levees and storage dams are particularly dangerous when design thresholds are exceeded in that unexpected failure can result in a rapid rise in water level and make evacuation and emergency protection extremely difficult Diversions or storm channels are less prone to catastrophic failure and the level of protection contemporarily be increased by emergency measures if the of the flood warning is sufficient Information must be credible and easily understood The above techniques combined with the flood forecast provide a very effective means of delineating areas at risk and for communicating this to the emergency response teams and the public Flood control storage may be one component of a reservoir development Over time the operation of the reservoir could be altered to enhance other beneficial uses of storage to the detriment of flood control A commitment to designated flood storage and to reservoir operation procedures to achieve that storage is needed Inspection rehabilitation and maintenance Structural works require a periodic and systematic inspection rehabilitation and maintenance programme to ensure that the design capabilities are maintained For example levees may be subject to weakening due to erosion during a past flood event by the actions of burrowing animals or the construction of utility lines through the levee Of particular importance is an inspection programme and responsibility assigned for rehabilitation and maintenance Structures such as dams should be subject to a dam safety programme usually at the national level to ensure that the specialized expertise required is available for the inspection of all structures Dam safety programmes are carried out in many countries and standards or guidelines are readily available 

Flood proofing of new and existing structures Any new construction permitted in the flood plain should be flood proofed to reduce future damages Building codes can be developed that minimize flood damages by ensuring that beneficial uses of buildings are located above the design flood elevation For example buildings can be raised above the design flood level by placement of fill stilts or piles used to elevate the structure and building utilities can be located above the flood level Ground floors can be designed in a way that little flood damage occurs through use of masonry materials and specifying that contents must be removable If any new development is allowed within the area then the impact of that development must be taken into account to ensure that flood levels do not rise significantly due to the additional constriction to flow Hydraulic analyses can be undertaken to ascertain the impacts of potential activities and to keep the rise to within acceptable limits Flood proofing of existing structures is difficult and expensive One successful strategy is to link flood disaster assistance available after a flood event to methods of reconstruction that minimize future flood damages This approach often requires additional funding over and above a payment for damages but can be costs hared between various levels of government and the owner This strategy is particularly useful when flooding is frequent and future disaster assistance can be expected as part of disaster policies Flood proofing of existing structures can include rising of structures to prevent damage relocation of utilities changed building use installation of protective walls and waterproof closures and use of materials that are not damaged by water and can be easily cleaned after the flood event Relocation of existing buildings and structures to an area that is not flood prone is also an option Buyout and relocation programmes for a particularly vulnerable development should form a component of flood proofing initiatives In many cases it may be more economical to buy out and relocate the existing use than to protect it Guidelines for Reducing Flood Losses A number of critical services such as water lines power pylons and telephone services often cross the flood plain These utilities can be protected against the ravages of flooding at relatively low cost through additional depth of burial a higher design standard for exposed components and rising of components above design flood levels Water supply and treatment plants are particularly vulnerable They are often located on the flood plain yet are critical for the protection of human health during and after a flood event Such structures need to be protected against extreme events and designed to prevent from flood waters or sewers 

Bridges and roads Bridges generally constrict the flow of water and they can act as artificial dams if debris jams on the structure In all cases their hydraulic characteristics must be considered at the design stage to prevent a UN acceptable rise of water levels upstream of the structure Bridges are important in terms of maintaining access for evacuation and delivery of medical and other emergency services Key transportation corridors should have high design standards that will with stand extreme flooding events However not all bridges require a high level of protection and the design criteria can be to a lesser standard that takes into consideration the possibility of overtopping Bridges are expensive and difficult to replace quickly after a flood event An alternative strategy is to design the approach roads to be the weak link in the chain so that extreme events wash out the road but do not damage the bridge Approaches can be quickly repaired after a flood event and transportation corridors restored Road design either parallel to the river or leading to bridges must be given careful consideration There is a temptation to raise roads that have been overtopped by flood events without giving adequate consideration to the number and size of openings necessary to pass local drainage or tributary inflow In such cases the road can artificially raise water levels upstream and cause additional flood damage Roads can act as levees when they are parallel to the river This is a sword while flood protection is provided the water level upstream can increase resulting in additional flood damages there Hydraulic studies must be undertaken before roads are raised to fully establish the impacts of these activities 

d Natural water retention Basins Construction and protection of all the flood protection embankments ring bunds and other bunds Dams and levees can also be constructed which can be used as temporarily storing space which reduces the chances of lower plains getting flooded 

e Buildings on elevated area The buildings in flood prone areas should be constructed on an elevated area and if necessary on stilts and platform However complete flood control in terms of structural methods of flood protection are neither economically viable nor these are environment friendly Therefore methods are becoming popular in mitigating flood disaster 

a Flood Plain Zoning Flood plain zoning which places restrictions on the use of land on flood plains can reduce the cost of flood damage Local governments may pass laws that prevent uncontrolled building or development on flood plains to limit flood risks and to protect nearby property Landowners in areas that adopt local ordinances or laws to limit development on flood plains can purchase flood insurance to help cover the cost of damage from floods Zoning of lands The best way to reduce future flood damages is to prevent development from occurring on lands Zoning of such lands is an effective approach but generally should be coupled with the broader planning mentioned above so that the land has a defined use Zoning can be used to reduce damages from flooding and be flexible enough to recognize that other forms of land use are compatible An example is agricultural use of lands in areas where water velocities are low enough not to cause serious erosion lands can continue to be used for agricultural purposes particularly in countries where the amount of agricultural land is limited and in food supply is a national goal It is important however to ensure that the supporting infrastructure such as buildings and houses are located away from the area or flood proofed It is also important that livestock machinery or stored crops can be evacuated quickly from the area in the event of a flood This underscores the importance of a flood forecast warning and response system Zoning of lands as ecological reserves or protected wetlands can often help to meet broader environmental or biodiversity goals In addition such lands often play an important role in sustaining the fishery and they can also act as temporary storage and infiltration areas Riparian buffer strips also reduce the movement of agricultural chemicals and nutrients into the aquatic system 

b Flood Forecasting and warning These are issued for different areas mostly by the Central water Meteorological department and by the State Flood Department However an effective Warning System is one that can release warning in advance 72hrs 48hrs and 24hrs It can change the existing scenario substantially and render informed decision making in adopting proper measures towards disaster preparedness mitigation control planning and management This kind of advance warning can help the authorities for better flood preparedness and also effective flood mitigation Therefore initiatives have to be taken to modernize the operation of Flood Forecasting Warning by adopting the state of art technology and integrating it into the forecast and warning dissemination process 

SURVEY AND ANALYSIS A variety of data information and analysis are required to understand the flood issues evaluate the current conditions and the impacts of floods and project the future scenarios of development and climate change and the ecological consequences for the formulation of the basin flood management plan The hydrological and meteorological data along with other physical characteristics of the basin are required for the analysis and simulation of physical characteristics of floods and flooding Data of current social conditions identification of beneficial aspects and negative socio economic impacts of floods future economic development projections are required to decide the goals target and activities to achieve the objectives A quick analysis of the kind of data required for the basin flood management plan needs to be established right at the start Following is the broad categories of data that may be required Basin condition Meteorological data Hydrological data Geomorphologic data Environmental data Social and economic condition Land use practices in the basin including flood plains Pattern of human settlements in and around flood plains Demographic profile of flood plain inhabitant Location of natural resources Livelihood sources in and around the flood plains Infrastructure and other assets in the flood plains Future development plan in the basin Social and economic damages in the past flood Some of the information may not be readily available and may require special surveys Particularly the information on the past floods and their beneficial and negative socio economic impacts may require to be assessed Such surveys may require a clear understanding and evaluation of how people are utilize periodic floods for their activities and how floods contribute to the functioning and maintaining the natural ecosystem The role of these ecosystems needs to be evaluated where possible in monetary terms Collection of data and information and its analysis may require inputs from experts outside the departments or institutions directly responsible and involved in the team created for the development of the plan The kind of expertise required to analyze and evaluate the impact of floods may have to be called from outside the designated team It is useful to draw upon the expertise of the specialist institutions within or outside the government Requirement of such external expertise should be assessed very early in the process and such expertise services arranged to be available to the team throughout the planning process Such an expert group may serve as the basis for continuous monitoring before during and after implementation of the plan SUGGESTED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR DISASTER MANAGEMENT IN PAKISTAN 

In the past Pakistan focus has been on control of floods in an manner with little or no attention to the policies Recent increasing trends in flood losses threatening sustainability of development however drawn wide attention of the policy makers It is important to remember that floods are the only natural hazards that also provide freshwater resources and flooding has natural benefits to the society and the environment As such the flood management policy has to be developed distinct from disaster management policies and have to be closely aligned to the water resources development and management The driving force behind establishing or modification of the flood management policy would be different in different physical and contexts These could be increasing damages increasing casualties migration of population from flood prone areas to cities or threat to food security Whatever the driving force the flood management policy has to be closely aligned with the national development vision and in certain cases the regional development goals 

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY National development indicates the direction and goals of social economic and cultural development of the nation principles and strategies of the management of natural land and human resources financial mechanism to sustain development within the country It indicates how national resources are deployed to achieve the national development goals There are several issues that constitute the national development that have relevance to flood management and need to be clearly identified Below are some of such issues Natural resources management including water resources for domestic agriculture fishery and industry Land use management agriculture industry dwelling urban development etc Environmental management conservation and modification Risk management policies Social development issues living conditions level of poverty equity and fairness principles For ensuring sustainable development in a country the risks posed by various natural hazards that can hamper growth and development need to be managed There are many kinds of risk that are rooted in both natural phenomena and human activities National development policy should stipulate the basic policy of risk management and it should be embodied in the strategy for development in various sectors Since the strategies for managing various risks have cross interactions an integrated approach such as management has the potential to enforce effectiveness and contribute to the rational utilization of national resources National development policy would generally provide the mechanism to formulate flood management strategy and action plan National development policy would articulate public participation in decision making process and defining the role and responsibility of stakeholders in the decision making process Basin flood management plan should be formulated drawing its inspiration from the national development policy NATIONAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT VISION AND POLICY A vision is a statement that describes a future state usually projecting for about 20 years Visions however tend be too vague and unachievable Ideally they should be framed in the context of the national vision for development The vision starts with the development of common view of the future and may include defined objectives and policies legislation and practice that would help translate them into realistic goals The vision can be applied at a regional level a shared watercourse level internal river basin a national level or a local level The vision can either take the shape of on overall statement of principle for the future of flood prone areas or be developed in more detail combining clear statements on Why flood management needs to be improved How risks due to floods are to be mitigated and When specific goals would be achieved Policies are more detailed than a vision A national flood management policy provides a framework gives direction for overall flood management in the country and facilitates coordination among various sectors and institutions related to flood issues Therefore a written policy document formally or informally adopted by government is a valuable indication of government commitment to sustainable development This is very relevant when considering a complex and cross cutting issue like water where many different interests have to be considered In order to formulate flood management policy it is necessary to delve into following pertinent questions What are the rivers of the policy What role do the flood plains play in the economy of the What issues in National development have relevance to the condition of floods or flooding and its management How flood management can contribute to the national development How flood risks can be appropriately factored in national development planning the existing policies not fulfilled their desired objectives How national development should be aligned to the existing and future flood risks How flood risks mitigation costs are shared between federal state and local governments on one hand and the individual on the other Point to be consider for sustainable Flood management policy for Pakistan A Ethical dimensions of water management Since there is no life without water those to whom water is denied are denied life Water for all and meeting minimum human needs are vitally tied to the principle of human dignity shared by all religious faiths We can see profound ethical implications in all aspects of traditional water uses such as flood control and management drought contingency planning and management irrigation hydroelectric power and agriculture water supply and sanitation navigation ecological maintenance and health and public health and disease control Ethical considerations around these uses concern the distribution of benefits and costs of the services who gets how much of the water and who pays the distribution of risks who is vulnerable and to what degree We witness that KPK is demanded interest on its water resources Sind complain about water shortage etc we should consider ethical dimension of water management to resolve this issue efficiency Participatory processes build on a classical notion in democratic theory that those who are affected by decisions should have a say in these decisions which affect their lives because in doing so they will becomes better citizens While making decisions on water resource management and distribution we must incorporate the say of different segment of society Conflict between the political and technical view Pakistan is facing conflict on water resource management political elites have their political agenda and they want political gain on the other hand technical experts have technical point of view which create conflict on water resource management resulted delay and vulnerability for the country recent is one of the outcome of this conflict Consensus building and conflict management Pakistan can develop water management policy through consensus building and conflict resolutions which can be achieving only through centralize approach Incentives and shared interests Sustainable Water resource management policy must be based on Incentives and shared interests if all the units of the federations and will be shared interest and incentive according to their proportion

If we put bird eye view on damages and losses resulted by 2010 floods the scale of damage is multidimensional but the sector suffer most of the damages is housing in Swat Gilgit and khoistan flash floods wipeout the whole structure but in plane area of KPK Punjab sind and Baluchistan Riverine flood caused both complete and partial damages to housing The traditional construction types and methods are different in these area the best way of reconstruction is to adopt owner driven approach which we already applied in 2005 earth quake this approach is cast effective and through this method government can reconstruct better houses against small compensation because it is fact that owner reconstruct his own house for his children as best as he can and on the other hand owner put effort and labor in it free of cost this is only way to reconstruct houses on large scale the most important thing which we must incorporate in reconstruction of houses policy is Flood resistance housing to avoid future damages as we know that many techniques exist to mitigate floods impact on new and existing houses Retrofitting methods or changes to existing houses to protect them against flood damage Depending on the applied retrofitting method it can either reduce or avoid structural damage within the house 

The aim of wet is to allow water to pass through the lower levels of the house in a controlled manner In this case the main inhabitable levels are situated above the BFE Interior and exterior hydraulic pressures are the same when water is allowed through the parts of the house which reduces damage to the structural foundation Damage to contents and building systems only occurs in the highly unlikely event of a flood The parts of the house below the BFE should be resistant to water meaning that electrical outlets sewage pipes and domestic machines have to be situated at higher levels 

Relocation The aim of relocation is moving a house to higher ground where the exposure to flooding is eliminated altogether Relocation consists of jacking up the house and placing it on a wheeled vehicle to transport it to the desirable site In most cases the existing foundation structure is not transported but is instead rebuilt at the new location Although this retrofitting method is the most effective it is only applicable where safe land and sufficient financial resources are available BFE Base Flood Elevation the water surface elevation of the annual chance flood also known as base flood or 100-year flood 

A floating house is a building that can float on the water due to the inherent buoyant forces in a flood From an environmental view it seems reasonable because it uses a natural energy force to solve the exact same problem These floating houses can generally be divided into two types according to their different modes of movement One is the boat floating house that can move freely in both vertical and horizontal directions Another is the lift floating house that can only move vertically up or down These two types can both make use of a special basement or big platform to generate enough floating force to push them selves up Shows two different floating houses the boat floating houses sometimes use an anchor system to fix themselves in the same location and often employ a floating plate to connect single units together The lift floating houses use column support methods to guarantee the vertical movement of the houses inside flexible columns and outside flexible columns Some inside flexible column designs use only one centered control column as the axis of the house leaving the house free to rotate around the column Alternatively in the outside flexible column design there are several columns which are attached to the house by steel corbel or hollow telescoping tubing piers 

Besides pushing houses up to let flood water flow through researchers also consider covering an entire house with an exterior waterproof barrier to protect the property Currently two kinds of such barriers are in use One employs a waterproof veneer a facade with waterproof materials that is added to exterior walls and seals all openings including doors It is a reasonably inexpensive way to prevent flood damage but high water pressure causes serious structural concerns to arise in areas where the flood depth may exceed one meter The other method already in use in Yalding 

Siding Fiber cement and vinyl sidings better withstand flood conditions than hardboard lap siding and plywood siding Replacing trim and corner boards with plastic or composite is likely more than restoring thorough drying renailing crack filling and repainting sawn wood trim Sheathing Plywood sheathing with lap siding is a good combination Plywood sheathing covered with plywood siding does not dry well and is not recommended gypsum sheathing Fiber hock WR Sheathing by USG is a good sheathing material Fiberglass and other insulation in the exterior cavity is not recommended Wood Framing Wood is a good flood framing material as long as the wall or floor system will allow it to dry Fiberglass and other insulation in the exterior cavity or subfloor are not recommended Insulation Spray polyurethane foam insulation is a much better for flood than fiberglass batt insulation Gypsum Wallboard drywall gypsum exterior sheathing can generally be restored to preflood condition with only cosmetic restoration Though it supports mold growth on the exposed surface it can be cleaned sanitized and restored Gypsum board that is able to dry completely within an appropriate time can generally be restored to preflood condition with only cosmetic restoration Although it supports mold growth on the exposed surface it can be cleaned sanitized and restored Gypsum wallboard is available with a skin The paper in wallboard is a source of food for mold and eliminating the food reduces the potential for mold growth Gypsum board with fiberglass batt insulation on exterior walls generally dries too slowly to maintain its integrity 

Wall Finishes flat enamel generally performs better than latex flaking and blistering very little and much easier to restore than other paints Standard drywall compound and paper joint tape performs very poorly under flood conditions Quick setting joint compound and fiberglass tape are generally a great improvement When used with the gypsum sheathing and paint these materials are expected to require minimal repair Vinyl wall covering will blister peel and debond after flooding It damages the surface of the gypsum board and may inhibit drying of the substrate or wall system Ceramic tile generally performs well under flood conditions with no deterioration Exterior Doors Exterior wood paneled doors exterior prehung doors in wooden frames fiberglass and metal doors can generally be restored to preflood conditions with minimal effort Do not fill the joints between the outside of the door frame and the rough opening with compressed fiberglass insulation because it may retain excessive moisture Filling with low expansion foam is the preferred option Interior Doors Considering the relatively low cost of replacement it is generally cost effective to replace all types of interior doors Windows Vinyl and aluminum window frames are generally able to be restored to preflood conditions with a minimal cleaning effort Do not fill the joints between the outside of the window frame and the rough opening with compressed fiberglass insulation because it may retain excessive moisture Filling with low expansion foam is the preferred option Floors Sealed concrete floor slab in all modules generally remain undamaged during and after flooding All carpeting including water resistant and padding holds or traps water and should be removed dried and cleaned as part of the flood recovery process Wood flooring holds or traps water above the slab and slows the overall drying process If wood flooring should be removed washed and stacked during the drying process Ceramic and quarry tiles absorb little water and do not significantly slow the drying process Wood and plywood subflooring and framing retains moisture and could be subject to moisture problems when UN faced fiberglass batt insulation is installed underneath the subflooring With no floor insulation the subflooring generally dries well Drying of the subfloor is predominantly through its bottom side Both and floating vinyl flooring on padding traps water so they should be removed during the drying process If the flooring can be removed without damaging it vinyl flooring can be reused if it is to do so Foundation Vents and Crawl Spaces Conventional foundation vents and operable flood vents both perform well Conventional vents may become blocked by debris during flooding which could cause damage to the structure Block open operable vents throughout the drying period to permit air to circulate through the crawl space homes undergoing restoration in wet climates may require regarding of the site to promote drying in the crawl space The crawl space area must be effectively sealed at all penetrations in the flooring to cut off potential pathways for the excess moisture and mold to enter the interior of the home Ductwork especially return air within the crawl space should also be sealed after it has been cleaned sanitized disinfected and repaired as necessary Install insulation and wall materials to the full height of the walls subjected to flooding Uncertainty regarding future flood levels and the wicking of floodwater through materials make the combining of conventional materials and flood damage resistant ones imprudent When selecting envelope materials and finishes and methods it is wise to assume that floodwater will permeate the system and that there will be hidden pockets of moisture that will require a means of escape This escape could be through permeable materials such as gypsum board or through cracks such as through the joints in vinyl siding Do block this means of drying with low permanence paints and wall coverings on walls or with caulking joints Compensation for housing We can change this disaster into window of opportunity if we adopt effective policies and measures Compensation will be dispersed in two installments first at plinth level and second at roof level this procedure will not only guaranteed reconstruction of houses but also secure the spending of compensation for reconstruction of house other wise victims spend this money for other purposes and remain shelter less Supportive Technologies A number of tools are available to array and display information for the use of technical experts to explain programmes of flood damage reduction to the and to communicate real time forecasts and warnings to the public In general the tools should be interactive in the sense that the information can be easily updated and flexible enough to develop scenarios and to provide visual and quantitative information regarding the state of conditions during the forecasted event 

Geological hazard Natural earth processes or phenomena that may cause the loss of life or injury property damage social and economic disruption or environmental degradation Geological hazard includes internal earth processes or tectonic origin such as earthquakes geological fault activity tsunamis volcanic activity and emissions as well as external processes such as mass movements landslides rockslides rock falls or avalanches surfaces collapses expansive soils and debris or mud flows Geological hazards can be single sequential or combined in their origin and effects Geographic information systems GIS Analysis that combines relational databases with spatial interpretation and outputs often in form of maps a more elaborate definition is that of computer programmes for capturing storing checking integrating analyzing and displaying data about the earth that is spatially referenced Geographical information systems are increasingly being utilized for hazard and vulnerability mapping and analysis as well as for the application of disaster risk management measures Geographic information systems Geographic Information Systems GIS provide a information and manipulation system useful in support off low forecasting and emergency response Information from a variety of sources and scales can be combined as a series of layers provided that the information can be identified in terms of the common denominator of location For example information on vegetative cover can be combined with soils and land slope information to estimate infiltration rates for forecasting purposes Similarly layers of utility land use flood plain delineation and structures information can help in the development and updating of emergency response plans A good representation of the basin topography is an important asset in flood forecasting emergency action and mitigation A digital elevation model DEM or digital terrain model DTM for the basin should be developed as part of any GIS Technologies exist that enable the construction of a seamless best available DEM In other words the DEM is constructed from whatever topographic information is available Parts of the basin or certain features may be very accurate while others may be quite basic The DEM can be improved with time The development of inexpensive global position indicators has made GIS information easier to obtain For example data network sites buildings or physical features can now be easily located with precision and at low cost Land use vegetative cover or soils information is also easier to assemble Mapping Maps of areas at risk from natural disasters are valuable information and communication tools They can be used for a wide variety of purposes ranging from flood plain delineation zoning and land use planning to presentation of information at public meetings Zoning maps however are static and may require updating with time as changes occur For static information such as the delineation of the area frequent updating is not required and maps are a useful reference tool for a wide variety of users Visualization techniques

Unpredictability of climatic extremes for specific regions and their extent which create uncertainty for water managers is the vital gap in the knowledge on climate change which needs to be addressed Latest scientific research Box should be applied in monitoring hazards through appropriate networks of seismological hydrological meteorological and marine parameters Sound water flood management should be based on a quantitative understanding of the flood risks When sufficient observational data are lacking models can not be used to generate information for since they lack baseline data from which to be calibrated To take the risk of flooding properly into account requires insight into the nature and magnitude of the risks in other words the probability of floods and their consequences economic damage numbers of casualties and how people will react to a catastrophic flood These are still not fully understood and call for research 98 Improved hydrologic networks can minimize uncertainties in forecasting and prediction thereby lessening risk This can be achieved in several ways including new and information from improved measurements quantity quality timeliness and measurement techniques The level of uncertainty for assessment and forecasting varies but is generally high in subtropical tropical polar and mountainous regions Networks also tend to be weak in developing countries especially the least developed amongst them Aside from technical considerations uncertainty in hydrologic data can be attributed to the access of hydrological data Developments in remote sensing satellite communication and information technology should be used for improving monitoring and developing computational models for forecasting and early warning of impending hazards The challenge before the international community is to support these activities particularly in developing countries where resources for such activities are limited There is a critical need for more availability and access to global hydrologic data information and products for climate and hydrologic research and applications including the validation and refinement of global circulation models and the quantification of the water balance and its variation over large basins and regions up to the global level 

Community participation Community activities play an important role as a of flood management Because Integrated Flood Management IFM seeks for practical aspects of managing floods community participation becomes fundamental and essential for each stage of the management that is preparedness for response to and recovery from flood disasters Community activities form an integrated component of flood management They seek to maximize the benefits through the related development activities within the river basin as a whole Community activities provide essential opportunities for water resources development within the context of Integrated Water Resources Management IWRM and IFM The benefits are derived at various levels of social and economic activities through development policy and planning As the community comprises of various its activities contribute to coordinate their interests and maximizing their benefits through building consensus within community including the benefits from ecosystem While extent of community participation is based on communitys historical experience and traditional backgrounds the starting point in IFM is the understanding of the vision for the river basin as a whole In the absence of organized community participation most of the activities are carried out at individual or household level driven by individual necessity Such activities are limited in their effectiveness and insufficient to protect the community at large and individuals in the long run from adverse impacts of floods On the other hand if the activities based on individual initiatives are pooled together and carried out in an organized manner at community level vulnerability and risks due to floods can be substantially reduced Reservoir Reservoirs play an important role in flood management They store flood water and reduce flood risks by attenuating the flood peaks and intensity of flooding in the downstream reaches Within the context of Integrated Water Resources Management IWRM water storage by reservoirs is an important means of meeting needs of various activities when the natural supply is less than the demand From both aspects reservoirs have been providing substantial benefits to human societies and their economic activities MODERATION OF FLOW Almost in all cases a reservoir is constructed to perform functions with water storage as the main function to different sectoral needs of the society such as water supply for drinking industrial use navigation or irrigation and hydropower generation In all these cases the reservoir serves an important function of moderating the flows It is useful to understand the special characteristics of reservoirs with following purposes 

Flood moderation Flood moderation reservoirs store all or a portion of the flood waters in the reservoir particularly during peak floods and then releases the water slowly Space within reservoir is generally reserved to store impending floods Small to medium floods generated from the catchment are fully captured by the reservoirs However extreme flood events are only partially attenuated and their transformation downstream is delayed The extent of attenuation depends on the available storage capacity vis vis the magnitude of the flood event The purpose of the reservoirs for flood management may be required only for a few days or weeks in any particular year store flood water to reduce discharge downstream try to keep space empty for storage of coming flood storage space in the reservoir is required appropriate operation in accordance with flow discharge into reservoir 

Hydro meteorological hazards Natural processes or phenomena of atmospheric hydrological or oceanographic nature which may cause the loss of life or injury property damage social and economic disruption or environmental degradation Floods bring misery to those that live in the area They can cause loss of life and often cause a great disruption of daily life water can come into peoples houses drinking water and electricity supplies may break down roads can be blocked and people can not go to work or to school Floods all over the world cause enormous damages every year like economic damages damage to the natural environment and damage to national heritage sites A flood is a situation in which water temporarily covers land where it normally doesnt This water comes from the sea lakes rivers canals or sewers It can also be rainwater Floods can be described according to speed flash flood geography or cause of flooding Several types of flooding will be described in these pages together with some aspects of hydrology Hydrology Water cycle Water storage A little or lots of water water quantity Rainfall intensity Speed water velocity Catchment area Hydro meteorological hazards include floods debris and mud floods tropical cyclones storm surges rain and wind storms blizzards and other severe storms drought desertification wild land fires temperature extremes sand or dust storms permafrost and snow or ice avalanches Hydro meteorological hazards can be single sequential or combined in their origin and effects HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL MONITORING The hydrological monitoring system consists of a network of rainfall and water level monitoring stations Assessment of flood hazard and existing flood control structures Identification and verification of locations for rainfall and water level gauges using the network density derived from a topographic map of the river basin Acquisition fabrication and installation of rainfall water level gauges and flood markers Identification and training of community volunteers as rain and water level observers and Discharge measurement and of rivers 

Pakistan Political leadership due to lack of knowledge and information wiping Pakistan from world Map As a disaster manger I think that Pakistan is a most vulnerable country now a days country is passing through most difficult time of its flood badly effect its socio economic structure but due early response of government of Pakistan and international community some how minimize the effects of flood in Pakistan is not simple disaster like 2005 earth quake technically we can not call it disaster because the losses and spread out of flood is above than disaster Government of Pakistan NDMA due to lack of knowledge declare and call it disaster which is totally wrong perception there is a dire need to understand the status and nature of 2010 flood 2010 flood is unique in its history and first in nature as a disaster management student the category of 2010 flood is slow onset disaster its type is natural disaster its kind is Riverine flood and its classification is complete floods is called complete disaster because of its spread out and losses COMPLETE DISASTER When any disaster caused multidimensional damages at large scale and losses are irreparable and not calculate able for long period of time this situation is called complete disaster In Complete disaster Relief and rehabilitation can not normalize the life of victim combination of Losses to a survivor life property livelihood culture economics health and habitat 2010 Floods Pakistan We can not manage any disaster before understanding its nature so I request government of Pakistan to understand the above stated condition of this disaster and take appropriate measures for its mitigation Disaster management is a collective responsibility of international community and affected country because poor or mismanagement of disaster affect the whole world secondly in some disaster cause or factor behind disaster is common like global warming which is one of major factor behind 2010 floods in Pakistan Global warming is international issue and developed countries contribute major share in global warming so these developed states are more responsible and pay more for disaster management to Pakistan Pakistan faced many disasters since its creation 2005 earth quake was major disaster but we not only manage it but change it to window of opportunity for survivors we shift affected community from poor kacha houses to earth quake resistance Paka houses on large scale and redevelop infrastructure far better then pre disaster situation 2010complete disaster is manageable through disaster management cycle and we can turn it into window of opportunity through planning and management 2010 flood can not destabilize the country like Pakistan because any disaster which can be managed through disaster management cycle can not destabilize country or government disaster provide more resources and opportunity of development which benefit government and rebuild better infrastructure for future development of country Country integrity and sovereignty is only threatened in disaster only due to complex disaster which can collapse both government and country I can foresee as disaster manager that Pakistan is leading toward complex disaster which is only instrument to destroyed or wipe a country from world map in present situation Pakistan can be saved only by avoiding complex disaster other wise Pakistan will be the history in books in near future Complex Complex disasters exist where adverse political conditions compound a disaster or emergency situation Such situations are complicated because the breakdown of the political structure makes assistance or intervention difficult This sort of emergency is usually associated with the problems of displaced people during times of civil conflict or with people in need caught in areas of conflict Government is first to respond any disaster but disaster de capacitate the government machinery and generate multidimensional challenges as we witness in 2005 and 2010 government of Pakistan fail to function its role in early recovery but if we put bird eye view on our political system and capacity of our national institution we can not criticized present government alone Past governments are more guilty I as disaster manager personally think that present government play a very positive role with poor national disaster systems President and prime minster try their level best to escape the country from complete disaster Pakistan is developing country and confronting many internal and external threats like terrorism law and order and sectarianism which slow its development and weakened government institutions resulted bad governance these challenges can not threaten Pakistan integrity and federation Political leadership due to lack of knowledge and selfishness caused direct damage to the sovereignty and integrity of Pakistan Mien Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and Iltaf Hussain are popular leaders and they are leading Pakistan toward a complex disaster I believe that both leader are patriotic as we are but due to lack of technical knowledge about disaster and for political gain they try to dissolve the present government of Pakistan which directly leading toward complex disaster Main nawaz Sharif declared the government corrupt and unpopular while Iltaf Hussain telephonically call for revolution both leader have followers who follow them blindly what ever they say I request their party workers and companions to stop their leader to do this because their thoughts can not change government of Pakistan and revolution it will change the Map of world were there is no Pakistan no MQM no muslin league Nawaz I am not a political worker I am a disaster expert I am not an advocate of present government and I have no affiliation with any political party but I am Pakistani citizen and it is my moral duty to guide people of Pakistan and leadership about the upcoming threat to Pakistan and my advise is same as an heart specialist advised a heart patient If Both political leader continue their miss leaded attitude no force can safe Pakistan your views lead the nation toward this future reality First government will lose its grip over the law and order then people will rise against them flood survivor suffering compel them to commit wide spread migration Mass murders happen frequently Deprived People start killing rich people villagers start attacking cities armed forces dis functional against widespread insurgency War lords govern and control small areas NGOs UN Agencies leave the country due to lack of security USA send force to other countries for maintain law and order but here they can not sent their forces because civil insurgency can not be control by any force or army and usa army is well aware of these fact so no one in the world will come forward to save Pakistan even our enemy India can not inter forces in these condition This is a picture of Complex disaster I appeal Nawaz Sharif and Iltaf Hussain to change their timing for political actions and consult with disaster expert about my Technical advice because complex disaster is internationally renowned theory When any country is passing through national disaster the best political leadership practice is to strengthen and build capacity of government without measuring its popularity even if you have foreign occupied government you will impose limitation on political activities for one year after national disaster postpone election if planned and postpone change of government for six month stop transfers of key government functionary In present situation both leader ideal role to play is to safeguard national interest they have say in parliament and they can safe Pakistan by correcting present government NDMA is illegal authority in Pakistan because she do not have constitutional cover legislate and build legal authority for disaster management for the larger interest of Pakistan Criticized government over mismanagement stop and identify corruption of government functionaries I hope both leader will consider my advice and secure interest of Pakistan
