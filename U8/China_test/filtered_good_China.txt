XIKOU VILLAGE China The muggy summer afternoon started like any other for Mao Juxian with a sink full of dishes to wash at her riverside diner But within minutes rain began pouring quickly turning things wrong 

After glimpsing outside her window Mao was shocked The river was overflowing and heading straight at her The and her elderly sister rushed to move whatever they could grab to the upstairs but the flood was moving faster In less than an hour the water inside the house reached their knees forcing the sisters to retreat to the second floor But the flood did stop its chase Several hours later it cut off electricity and phone service swept away furniture and almost reached the ceiling of their first floor We were scared to death worrying our house would collapse any minute For the whole night none of us dared to sleep recalled Mao Instead they were helplessly watching the water rise Luckily the flood stopped two feet short of them and finally faded away in the morning Three days later while carrying a wet dining table outside to dry Mao said she never imagined going through a flood This year we did even have rain until two weeks ago And the river had so little water that parts of its bottom were parched Such sudden flood from rivers is rare But that deluge would not be the last nor would it be the worst Over the past three weeks China southern provinces many of which have yet to recover from an unusual drought entered a battle against numerous deadly floods In one such province called Hunan a cluster of villages that this year saw only one third of the average rainfall suddenly experienced the heaviest rain in the past 300 years That caused mudslides that claimed the lives of 20 villagers Nationwide the floods killed dozens more forced millions of people to leave their homes and mounted an extra billion on top of economic losses from the preceding drought While a rainy June is normal here such extreme weather and the dramatic shift from dry to wet are says Yang Fuqiang senior adviser on climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council This is a clear proof of climate change Yang said And it hits less developed regions hardest making the poor even poorer Craving rain That pretty much the situation in Xikou village and its neighboring Kaihua County where water resources are almost four times the national average and yet villagers are increasingly feeling the pinch in getting water For Zhou Wenhan watering his riverbank fields is no longer an easy matter Over the past years Zhou witnessed the river level shrinking to a point that no water is able to flow into channels and to reach his fields And alternative ways like pumping water from underground were abandoned due to prohibitive costs of the operation While his neighbors can carry water from wells Zhou ca The left hand is paralyzed leaving him at the mercy of the weather And this year as his prayer for rain was answered Zhou had to make a tough decision I switched from growing rice to growing peanuts he said Peanuts can grow with little water but it only generates half of my previous income Even for villagers who are physically and financially stronger than Zhou and can soften their dependence on the weather the missing rain drops did go unfelt Li Zibing a vegetable grower in neighboring Huadong village uses a pumping system together with some 400 farmers during low rainfall But this year extreme low is something that the pump could help with For every 15 minutes of pumping water villagers had to wait half an hour until the pump recovered And not enough water could be fetched and led to their thirsty crops said Li adding that the whole village craved rain The rain did come finally but not in a way they expected Livelihoods going down the drain On June 15 a record rain the heaviest in the past half century dropped on Li village It inundated his greenhouses and destroyed his hard work within hours My peppers had just gotten ripe to be sold But there is nothing that I can do with them now By sun rise they will all go bad said Li while staring at a field of peppers covered with a thick layer of brown mud Growing vegetables is my only income he continued I am now 50 Even if I want to work in factories nobody would hire me because I am too old What else can I do for a living Several miles away another farmer was asking the same question Handicapped Zhou stood in his peanut field which a few days ago was rich with green sprouts but is now a mix of muddy dirt and garbage left by the flood I planted those peanuts with only one hand But when the flood came I could do nothing except watching sighed Zhou The flood was so fierce that it even crashed a brick house next to my field Who dared to go save crops at such time Zhou already restarted planting and this time he is betting on corn Still he is sure whether this could help him make ends meet Even if I successfully grow the new crops and harvest it the cost has already doubled And I have to spend extra cash on fertilizers since my rich soil was washed away by the flood While Zhou attributes it all to natural forces some villagers are pointing fingers at a different suspect Minor impacts for experts dire consequences for farmers We believe the flood was caused by upstream hydropower stations which released water amid heavy rains and did even notify us said Lin Weishun a who runs a pig farm along a river at a nearby village called Yexi Before the flood the river level was very low Even if rain continued pouring for another few days it should not have risen so abruptly Lin explained While there is no evidence to support Lin claim it is uncommon for hydropower stations to empty their water reservoirs before heavy rains And if that is timed well experts say the released water would intensify floods downstream though only making a slight impact that would last no more than a day However for villagers like the pig farmer Lin a slight change is big enough to be tipped over the edge As the river water came flooding Lin rushed to save his pigs With water up to his waist he struggled to catch dozens of small pigs and carried them upstairs to his home But there was little Lin could do with the bigger ones each weighing more than 400 pounds I called my brothers to come and help but the roads were already blocked by the flood It was so distressing when I saw the flood sweeping away my pigs but I could do anything Lin said while smoking one cigarette after another The flood took off with two dozen pigs worth but what was washed away is Lin loan To build this pig farm he borrowed from the bank which he would pay back if the pigs were lost Meanwhile Lin will have to bear another several hundred dollars for rebuilding his pig sheds which collapsed in the flood And until the sheds are ready pigs are running day and night in Lin kitchen and living room leaving their smelly gifts behind But Lin said he is used to the smell I did take one day off since I built the farm three years ago Even during the Chinese New Year I was still here to clean up pig waste he said And all this hard work is now gone with the flood Copyright 2011 E E Publishing

BEIJING AP Major rivers burst their banks in southern China triggering massive floods that have killed 132 people and forced to flee their homes the government said Sunday With dozens missing and more storms forecast the death toll was expected to rise More than 10 million people have been affected since torrential rains began June 13 including those who have been injured stranded or have suffered property losses the Ministry of Water Resources said in a news release While the death toll was up from 90 on Saturday the number of evacuees was lower than the previous day figure of million Another 86 people are still missing China sustains major flooding annually along the mighty Yangtze and other major rivers but this year floods have been especially heavy spreading across nine provinces and regions in the south and along the eastern coast Thousands of houses have been destroyed and economic losses have topped 14 billion yuan the ministry said 

More than five million people are now reported to have been affected by deadly floods in eastern China Torrential rain was continuing leaving large parts of Zhejiang and Hubei provinces under water news agency Xinhua said It said nearly businesses were being disrupted and crops destroyed pushing up food prices This month flooding the worst since 1955 has already left about 170 people dead or missing reports say The government has mobilised troops to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people China disaster alert has been raised to the highest level four Downpours earlier this week triggered landslides that buried houses and killed at least two people in Zhejiang and another two in Hubei The floods come after months of drought in the centre and north of the country Some areas along the Yangtze River have suffered their worst drought in half a century Despite the rain officials have warned that the crop shortages and dislocation caused by drought will remain severe Analysts say crop shortages in China could affect prices around the world 

Overall 40 rivers have risen above safe limits stressing dykes and dams including those on China largest waterway the Yangtze River which is flooding downstream while experiencing a severe drought near its source in the north China disaster level has been raised to four the highest on the scale In a statement on its website on Friday China Ministry of Civil Affairs said Since June 13 the damage caused by the rainstorms has led to the emergency evacuation of people to safety The current round of heavy rains began in early June Since then more than a million and a half people have been displaced in the central and southern regions of the country and at least 168 deaths have been reported Meteorologists in Beijing are predicting more heavy rain in Sichuan Guizhou and Zhejiang this weekend 

The government has mobilized its forces to aid in the massive evacuations According to Reuters local authorities are distributing a box of instant noodles and a carton of bottled water to those affected by the flood But villagers have reported that survival is difficult especially for those still trapped by the flood waters in small villages and distribution of aid is slow with some not receiving any A villager was quoted by Reuters To be frank those rescue boats can not go through those narrow lanes inside the village A lot of them depend on their relatives rowing small wooden boats to get to them It is hard to help these people inside there Another villager Shou Pengfei said Some did not even get any relief items There is no electricity and you get bitten by mosquitoes all the time 

According to the Beijing Climate Centre weather trends have shifted drastically Currently the rain is coming in shorter but fiercer bursts with protracted periods of drought in between the torrential rain 

The heavy rainfall is not likely to reduce the crop failure caused by months of drought especially in the north the heart of China bread basket where many rivers have dried up According to reports the northern countryside has been left devastated by the droughts Huge dams hundreds of meters wide are now small muddy pools Large cities such as Beijing are draining the underground water sources and China is facing a water crisis Meanwhile China is engaged in a huge engineering project designed to move water to the parched north and away from the flooded south The water project is a massive series of canals and pipes designed to carry water from the Yangtze and Yellow rivers to Beijing It is likely analysts predict that Chinese crop shortages will increase food prices worldwide Even before the latest flooding the severe drought in the north caused a shortfall in China crop yields that will likely affect the price of wheat and may propel a price increase in global markets 

Chinese officials say the death toll from heavy rains in central and southern provinces has risen to at least 94 and that 78 people are state flood control and drought relief agency said Sunday that torrential rains in the past week have triggered floods and landslides in 13 provinces affecting more than million residents The agency said the inclement weather also destroyed close to hectares of Xinhua news agency reports that the meteorological administration issued a emergency alert Sunday for areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River It quotes officials as saying these areas will be swamped by torrential rains Monday raising the risk of flash floods and landslides in areas that were recently hit by droughts Under the alert local authorities will monitor weather changes 24 hours a day and give warnings in case of possible natural China Guangdong province was hit by its first tropical storm of the summer Xinhua reports that the storm named Sarika made landfall with wind speeds of more than 70 kilometers per hour and was moving rains and thunderstorms continued Sunday in most parts of China

Now we have this 50 year flood Again without the to hold back the up river waters had the rainstorms reached the upper reaches of the Yangtze the floods downriver would have been even more devastating and affect an even bigger area No the rains have reached there yet But at least there is the very significant comfort that should it rain excessively there the runoff wo reach downriver unrestricted to add to the downriver miseries Any overabundance of water can be be held back by the for a controlled release Nothing much can be done to control the current downriver floods With the it is assured that it wo get any worse 

Hope the people are found and returned to normal soon If the region is a natural flood zone or new farming district did the dams impact natural flow of water Is the draining system updated to all connect and filter somewhere needed To sump pump it out and put where lacking water would make sense pooled and filtered Could the crops be pulled from the water and transplanted to other regions or rooftops to grow May the wasted infrared glasses around here be put to better use with the military on after storm units for trouble as this Move the displaced into hotels nearby Dievs to you Maija from Detroit

XIKOU VILLAGE China The muggy summer afternoon started like any other for Mao Juxian with a sink full of dishes to wash at her riverside diner But within minutes rain began pouring quickly turning things wrong 

After glimpsing outside her window Mao was shocked The river was overflowing and heading straight at her The and her elderly sister rushed to move whatever they could grab to the upstairs but the flood was moving faster In less than an hour the water inside the house reached their knees forcing the sisters to retreat to the second floor But the flood did stop its chase Several hours later it cut off electricity and phone service swept away furniture and almost reached the ceiling of their first floor We were scared to death worrying our house would collapse any minute For the whole night none of us dared to sleep recalled Mao Instead they were helplessly watching the water rise Luckily the flood stopped two feet short of them and finally faded away in the morning Three days later while carrying a wet dining table outside to dry Mao said she never imagined going through a flood This year we did even have rain until two weeks ago And the river had so little water that parts of its bottom were parched Such sudden flood from rivers is rare But that deluge would not be the last nor would it be the worst Over the past three weeks China southern provinces many of which have yet to recover from an unusual drought entered a battle against numerous deadly floods In one such province called Hunan a cluster of villages that this year saw only one third of the average rainfall suddenly experienced the heaviest rain in the past 300 years That caused mudslides that claimed the lives of 20 villagers Nationwide the floods killed dozens more forced millions of people to leave their homes and mounted an extra billion on top of economic losses from the preceding drought While a rainy June is normal here such extreme weather and the dramatic shift from dry to wet are says Yang Fuqiang senior adviser on climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council This is a clear proof of climate change Yang said And it hits less developed regions hardest making the poor even poorer Craving rain That pretty much the situation in Xikou village and its neighboring Kaihua County where water resources are almost four times the national average and yet villagers are increasingly feeling the pinch in getting water For Zhou Wenhan watering his riverbank fields is no longer an easy matter Over the past years Zhou witnessed the river level shrinking to a point that no water is able to flow into channels and to reach his fields And alternative ways like pumping water from underground were abandoned due to prohibitive costs of the operation While his neighbors can carry water from wells Zhou ca The left hand is paralyzed leaving him at the mercy of the weather And this year as his prayer for rain was answered Zhou had to make a tough decision I switched from growing rice to growing peanuts he said Peanuts can grow with little water but it only generates half of my previous income Even for villagers who are physically and financially stronger than Zhou and can soften their dependence on the weather the missing rain drops did go unfelt Li Zibing a vegetable grower in neighboring Huadong village uses a pumping system together with some 400 farmers during low rainfall But this year extreme low is something that the pump could help with For every 15 minutes of pumping water villagers had to wait half an hour until the pump recovered And not enough water could be fetched and led to their thirsty crops said Li adding that the whole village craved rain The rain did come finally but not in a way they expected Livelihoods going down the drain On June 15 a record rain the heaviest in the past half century dropped on Li village It inundated his greenhouses and destroyed his hard work within hours Next Page For more news on energy and the environment visit is published by Environment Energy Publishing Read More

Posted Thu 22 Sep 2011 GMTPosted The US is no longer capable of pulling the world out of economic crisis Only China has the resources if it chooses to use themCan China save the world economy That is a question that people should be asking as the other potential candidates withdraw from the race At the moment the economies of the United States Europe and Japan are all suffering from weak growth or worse The debt crisis of eurozone countries threatens another financial crisis that could lead to another plunge in output not just in Europe but throughout the the actors who could in principle take steps to reverse this dismal course of events are largely paralysed The eurozone countries are struggling with efforts to form the necessary fiscal union to support their currency This requires creating a new legal structure while also confronting intense political opposition in Germany and other countries that will be asked support the debt of the Greece and other struggling the European Central Bank ECB is finding it difficult to break with its cult of inflation targeting even after the economic disaster caused by this policy focus It actually raised its overnight rate by percentage points in the spring slowing growth and increasing the cost of borrowing for governments The United States does not face the same imminent crisis but it is likely to see slow growth and rising unemployment as both fiscal and monetary policy are largely checkmated by politics Furthermore a eurozone financial will almost certainly lead to a recession in the US as Japan has just seen another prime minister sent packing after failing to deal effectively with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami The country now has its fourth prime minister in four the key actors in the wealthy countries either unwilling or unable to take the necessary steps to support the world economy it is reasonable to ask whether China can fill the gap Certainly China has the ability to act as a backstop for the world economy if it chooses to play this a purchasing power parity basis China economy is already more than 75 as large as the US economy It is projected exceed the size of the US economy by 2016 China also has a vast amount of reserves holding almost in US dollar assets and has close to in total would need only a small fraction of this wealth to have an enormous impact on the sovereign debt crisis in Europe In the case of Greece it would need to set some floor on the value of Greek debt as an orderly restructuring is arranged Greece has roughly in debt outstanding Much of this debt has already been partially written down by its holders Certainly in debt purchases would be more than sufficient to arrange an orderly and restructuring of Greece debt to a sustainable other troubled countries actually suffer primarily from a crisis of confidence more than a serious debt problem For example Spain has a debt to GDP ratio that is just over 60 well within anyone conception of manageable Italy has a more troubling debt to GDP ratio of 120 but has a budget In both cases if interest rates could be kept at reasonable levels the debt burden could be easily rates on both countries bonds have soared in recent months as the ECB has demanded harsh austerity measures at a time when the downturn has sent budget deficits soaring The austerity measures threaten a downward spiral where weak growth leads to rising deficits which in turn require further austerity measures With the ECB determined to tell investors that sovereign debt can default they have created a perfect recipe for a can reverse this picture by providing guarantees to support the bonds of these governments By setting a floor on the price of their bonds or a cap on interest rates it can ensure that they can borrow at interest rates that make their debt sustainable In addition by easing up on the austerity measures demanded by the ECB actually the IMF and European Union are also actors in this story China intervention can help these countries to return to normal levels of growth reducing the burden of the debt in the future It is likely that such guarantees would never cost China anything since the European governments would have little problem meeting their debt service obligations once they return to healthy growth sort of intervention by China would not require altruism Europe is a substantial market for China exports as is the United States If the eurozone collapses the resulting financial crisis and economic fallout will send China exports plummeting just as happened in the fall of 2008 China already intervenes to support its exports that is why it holds almost in US government debt so this idea of intervening to sustain export markets is not new to the Chinese government The only thing that would be new would be the form of the China were to take this path it would provide enormous benefits to the world economy The wealthy countries would have to acknowledge China role as the leading economic force in the world They would also have to acknowledge the errors of their boneheaded economic leadership that put them in a situation where they could

Posted Thu 22 Sep 2011 GMTPosted Troy Davis execution caused a greater outcry than usual in the US But would justice have been better served by commutation I was at a Scouts camp in Cornwall one brisk spring morning in 1960 when we heard that Caryl Chessman a Californian robber and rapist had finally been executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin jail after 12 years on death row Years later I discovered that my future Guardian boss Ian Aitken 84 this week had been one of the reporters covering his last vu all over again this morning when mainstream media confirmed angry overnight reaction in the Twittersphere to the news that Troy Davis was executed by lethal injection in a prison south of Atlanta Georgia in the early hours of today despite the rituals of last minute appeals and delays granted then overturned as in the Chessman time the process has taken 22 years since Davis was convicted of the shooting of Mark MacPhail an policeman trying to break up a brawl Davis died still protesting his innocence as he had during the long legal battle for his life during which key witnesses tried to withdraw their evidence as Ed Pilkington at the prison in Jackson as Aitken was at San Quentin 51 years ago explains here in 10 crisp hundred protesters were outside the jail and countless prominent people and organisations around the US and the wider world appealed for clemency The US supreme court was instrumental in ensuring that Davis fourth execution date would be his woman reporter who has witnessed 12 executions in the state she practices detachment and always has a very very long shower afterwards she told Radio Today programme said she had not experienced such an outcry also sounded a bit perky for my taste but seemed satisfied that the evidence against Davis was solid To many people in many countries that detail will matter To others the principle that capital punishment the state taking lives in cold blood is the only thing that matters and is wrong in any speaking that is the European view nowadays though the abolitionist movement has grown worldwide in recent decades 96 countries have abolished the death penalty compared with 16 barely 30 years is one of them whereas the US 46 executions in 2010 and China an estimated are not Iran and North Korea are in the No and No spot Muslim states being most conspicuous on the execution list Japan executed two of ironies to chew over in that list Europe the most godless continent opposes capital punishment but is a world leader in promoting abortion China at least has the consistency of supporting what some call the double death Times carries a report on Davis impending death but a more censorious and prominent one on Iran execution of a in public and from a had also been convicted of murder killing a athlete after a driving dispute as recently as July they do hang around with appeals in Iran He claimed to have acted in and called out for his mother as the crowd cried Allah Akbar His age officials claimed he was 18 by their calendar amounts to a breach of international law critics coincidence not President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is due to address the UN general assembly today his usual fiery rant doubtless inflamed by persistent speculation that the clerical authorities who call the shots and hangings in Iran are getting fed up with his economic know the feeling do we Also in New York David Cameron speech the BBC reports in the adjoining item to Troy Davis execution will call on the international community to intervene more to stop repressive regimes from slaughtering their own people Another irony there then it will probably go unremarked at Turtle examination of the Davis case requires several threads to be unpicked Those who oppose capital punishment in all circumstances do have a problem it always wrong I do take that and societies have reserved the right to execute people for a variety of crimes from treason to stealing a loaf of bread down the ages and some still do The pendulum of intellectual fashion if I can call it that I think I will moves both ways over time allowing everyone to take a turn at feeling the US the issue is one for the 50 states to decide not a federal issue under the constitution of 1787 Most still do it occasionally 14 plus the District of Columbia do mostly in the and Michigan alone never has Britain abolitionists have been reducing the list of capital crimes for 200 years and had it suspended for murder in 1965 mainland only made permanent in 1969 The last offences including treason went in 1998 and the UK signed the protocol of the European convention on human rights in so there the decision remains for the the course of the century we seem to have executed nearly 700 people Were mistakes made Of course and it was Timothy John Evans hanging in 1950 on the evidence of the serial murderer John Christie which crucially turned public opinion and home secretaries away from the practice But the other side can argue and does that mistakes that allow killers to kill again also results in the deaths of innocents It a powerful point the case of Davis things seem if not straightforward then at least to have a balance of propriety Too many young Davis was 20 at the time African American men go to jail in the US and disproportionately too many go to the execution cell Race is an aggravating factor even now and especially in the south even never wise to learned courts which have been through the evidence as the US supreme court African American members included has done and upheld the verdict of lower courts Why has this case become a cause celebre when others do not Perhaps because the weight of evidence against a safe conviction is as Pilkington reports so heavy But perhaps for other dispute is the idea that appeals can drag on for 20 years Who benefits Mostly lawyers I imagine though sometimes a reprieved or acquitted defendant There are too many lawyers in America and not enough justice I suspect My sense is that justice might better have been served here by commutation but American courts like everyone else do not like to be told what to do by eloquent example of the search for justice surfaced this week in the person of former policeman John Murray who cradled the dying Pc Yvonne Fletcher in his arms after she was shot by unknown Libyan official s from their London embassy in suspects were expediently allowed home by Margaret Thatcher government But Murray promised his colleague he would find her killers and have them brought to liberated Libya this week he seems to be fulfilling his DavisCapital

Posted Wed 21 Sep 2011 GMTPosted Prime minister will use his speech at the United Nations to ask international community to act against repressive regimesDavid Cameron will issue a plea on Thursday to world leaders to be prepared to intervene again when civilians are massacred by repressive regimes as he warns that the UN is in danger of losing its nerve after the campaign in his most wide ranging speech on foreign policy as prime minister Cameron will declare that the UN must change its ways if it is to avoid losing the opportunity provided by the Arab to the UN general assembly Cameron will say You can sign every human rights declaration in the world but if you stand by and watch people being slaughtered in their own country when you could act then what are those signatures really worth The UN has to show that we can be not just united in condemnation but united in action acting in a way that lives up to the UN founding principles and meets the needs of people everywhere Britain

agree to tough new sanctions against Syria where more than people have died since the uprising against the Assad will not name Moscow and Beijing though he will make it clear that momentum is in danger of being lost when he says The international community has found its voice in Libya We must not now lose our nerve We must have the confidence to speak out and act as necessary to support those who seek new freedoms The prime minister who received a rapturous reception with Nicolas Sarkozy in Tripoli and Benghazi last week arrived in New York on Wednesday bolstered by the success of the Libya campaign He briefed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton the US secretary of state on his visit to Libya during a meeting praised Cameron as outstanding and hailed the special relationship Obviously there is an extraordinarily special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom the president said I have always found Prime Minister Cameron to be an outstanding partner so I am very grateful for his friendship his hard work his dedication and his leadership on the global stage Cameron briefed the president on his speech which will draw comparisons with Tony Blair famous Chicago oration in April 1999 In that speech delivered during the Kosovo campaign the former prime minister outlined what came to be known as the doctrine of liberal Street sources stressed that Cameron has a different vision to Blair who is in New York in his role as the Middle East peace envoy Cameron believes Libya shows the conditions that need to be met before action is taken against repressive regimes The UN must agree to the action Other countries in the region must be supportive in the way that the Arab League supported the zone over Libya Action must be tailored to the needs of the particular country in conditions mean that the most immediate action envisaged by the prime minister against Syria will involve tougher sanctions but not military action Cameron will condemn the Assad regime though he will stop short of demanding fresh sanctions On Syria it is time for the members of the security council to act Of course we should always act with care when it comes to the internal affairs of a sovereign state But we can not allow this to be an excuse for indifference in the face of a regime that week after week arrests intimidates tortures and kills people who are peacefully trying to make their voices heard Cameron said the Arab spring showed that the Palestinians have the right to live in a viable state But he made clear Britain unease with Mahmoud Abbas plans to make a declaration of statehood when he said the focus should be on the resumption of negotiations with Israel The prime minister who discussed the Palestinian plans with Obama said No resolution can on its own substitute for the political will necessary to bring peace Peace will only come when Palestinians and Israelis sit down and talk to each other make compromises build trust and agree The prime minister who acknowledges that his premiership has been transformed by Libya will hail the people of Tripoli and Benghazi for ensuring that their country did not join an infamous roll call of failure This revolution truly belongs to the Libyan people The United Nations played a vital role authorising international action But let be clear the United Nations is no more effective than the nation states that come together to enforce its will On this occasion a coalition of nations across the Western and Arab world had the will to act In so doing they stopped Benghazi from joining Srebrenica and Rwanda in history painful roll call of massacres the world failed to prevent Cameron will outline how the Arab Spring presents a challenge to all regions including Europe These are first that Europe must show it can reform its aid and trade strategy Britain believes that France is guilty of promoting protectionist barriers which block agricultural imports to the will also say that the African Union should meet the opportunities of this century with the same courage that won liberation in the last This will be seen as a dig at Jacob Zuma the South African president who was critical of the campaign against Muammar CameronArab and Middle East unrestLibyaMiddle EastAfricaSyriaBashar NationsTony BlairPalestinian territoriesIsraelNicholas 2011 Guardian News and Media

Posted Tue 20 Sep 2011 GMTPosted Migrants who toil in the cities still face a system of segregation and exploitation But many are now demanding fairnessWhen I walk into Beijing migrant worker slums five minutes from the financial centre and shopping malls I understand what Ai Weiwei means when he calls Beijing a city of violence violence against a large section of its working population and their families We live under the same sky why are we not entitled to the same rights is a question many ask in Xinzhuang and other migrant the past month schools for children of migrant workers who build the capital offices and mansions clean its streets and guard its security have been shut down with more to follow in the coming weeks Tens of thousands of migrant children are left without schools and nurseries to go to Here in Beijing two worlds exist in parallel Those of rural origin a third of the city 19 million population are ruthlessly segregated from the urban dwellers economically socially and culturally Despite the attempt to pretend this is a local issue and only local governments are responsible the injustices experienced by migrants are very much a result of central system that has maintained the segregation within China cities is hukou household registration set up in 1958 to control migration While rhetorically the peasantry was the vanguard of the revolution and indeed the 1949 revolution would have been possible without them in practice in China drive to industrialisation the peasantry became an unchangeable category of social class in the Maoist theory of the four blocs of society known as new democracy xinminzhu zhuyi role was to produce and feed the cities and support the modernisation process of their motherland Peasants class status was fixed as shown on their ID no matter what they might choose to do Wo shi nongmin Iam a peasant I had migrant workers tell me about their class origin as if it were a stamp on your body for life It was impossible for peasants to move their hukou to the class status has changed since Deng Xiao Ping gaige kaifang economic reforms and opening up in the late The countryside underwent while it remained the nation production backyard Agricultural production increased in the early stage of the reforms in releasing the productive forces as Deng called it but with rampant corruption and heavy taxation the poverty deepened Since the half of the 400 million rural working population have been pushed off the land seeking a livelihood away from their rural residents came to the cities they immediately faced discrimination and exclusion Migrant workers first welcome was being told to stand in the peasant worker queue inside train stations And there was no way to disguise class origin the migrants could be distinguished by their brown tanned faces and bent backs due to years of farm work They spoke their own dialects instead of proper Mandarin Many faced verbal abuse as soon as they the three decades of gaige kaifang numerous barriers have been set up to discourage their migration the strict requirement for the unaffordable temporary residency permit and the random street search by police Most migrants feel they are a hidden army of labour that supplies industries and urban life with their sweat and blood while enduring when China boasts growth and foreign reserves migrants continue to be burdened with the hukou system The criteria for applying for a hukou remain harsh and unreachable for most migrants and many work for years without any status Without hukou they ca access services in the cities such as healthcare education and housing While urban dwellers pay a minimal cost for medical care many migrants have to return home for treatment While urban children enjoy free primary education migrants either are entitled or ca afford it monthly tuition fees in a Beijing primary school would cost a migrant parent of their migrant activist told me These children are treated as everyone else They called the mobile students who ca go to state schools Their parents have for years sent their children to privately run schools without proper facilities or curriculum InHaiding Chaoyang and Daxing the townships within Beijing hundreds such private schools were set up Some are run as makeshift charities others but they are inadequate to provide proper education Yet education in many people eyes is the only way they can lift themselves out of call hukou the fundamental evil Even the National Development and Reform Commission admits it is an institutional barrier and believes it should be scrapped However these institutions are in the position to change things Protection of migrant workers rights is a rhetorical statement of state organisations but the government has shown no wish to listen to migrant workers demands The only officially recognised channel through which migrant workers can voice their discontent is by petitioning the local authorities a tradition Little happens as a result protests are classified as mass incidents and often dispersed for change have so far fallen on deaf ears Some suspect that migrant children schools are being closed as a disincentive to future migration Migrant workers NGOs face constant government monitoring and pressure not to speak out Meanwhile the trade unions are ineffective and seen by many workers as a paper tiger recent years migrants have raised their demands through protests road blockages and spontaneous strikes Although these have not always proved effective workers have become more aware of their collective strength In the past year they have won some improvements in wages and working conditions Many migrant workers now better informed are far less willing to accept the status quo As they grow in confidence the regime will find it increasingly difficult to ignore their demands China rulers should realise now that it is in their interests to

Posted Tue 20 Sep 2011 GMTPosted Former Lib Dem leader says in the world will require potentially and dangerous adjustment to global structuresAmid all the ritual navel gazing of a party conference there was much coverage of Paddy Ashdown gloomy prognosis not just for Britain but for the wider west If he even half right and he probably is it will put the coalition manoeuvres and Ed Miliband finer points of policy reform into the sort of shade from which no traveller returns even in was he on about Speaking on the panel at the Guardian annual fringe debate Allegra Stratton reports the domestic politics here Ashdown fretted about the growing number of discontinuities in the world today which will require a potentially terrifying and dangerous adjustment to global structures in order to realign what we think the world is like to what the world is actually like What did he mean Well that the UN is meant to be running all sorts of global activities but is increasingly marginalised because it is structured around the world as it was in the late after the defeat of Germany and meant that the US is still seen as the world great economic and military power but is increasingly in financial hock to China That Europe is regarded as the world No economic power but is actually in debt and sure you get the picture I bang on about such incongruities here all the time so it was good to hear his Paddyship doing the same on a public platform Only the Lib Dems have the courage to preach such truths to power he insisted among other speakers at the Birmingham conference making similar points about the party role in the necessary readjustments are not simply within the western sphere US and Europe across the north Atlantic They mark the end of a western hegemony since the decline of the Muslim Ottoman empire on Europe eastern flank he said though he could have added the decay of Ming China no relation to Ming Campbell which too many people take for and China are returning to the centre of the world stage if we ca see that we are bloody fools he told a lunchtime audience and we can no longer assume that the US will be our friend of last resort there to rescue us from ourselves as it did twice in the century Yes to US is increasingly preoccupied with the Chinese challenge in the Pacific It has a president Who has the biggest naval presence tackling Somali piracy in the Indian Ocean he asked Why China it a mercantilist power and needs to keep its sea lanes open for trade as Britain once so When Britannia ruled the waves many pirates were Chinese No longer Their pirates now wear suits and come ashore to take our wealth quite legally They are busy buying EU companies and sovereign debt at good prices as the US once you may feel in view of the eurozone turbulence Ashdown a former diplomat services squaddie and later Lib Dem leader thinks the correct British response should be closer integration with Europe Far from apologising for their enthusiasm the Lib Dems should become even more than they are so Because a Russia rich on oil and gas is moving menacingly to reestablish its sphere of influence lost when the Soviet bloc collapsed after 1989 and seeks to destablise or even break up the EU Fanciful I say remain wary of this sort of integrationist talk it very difficult for one thing but not half as wary as I am about demands on the Tory right that the eurozone weakness is David Cameron cue to demand fresh concessions from Brussels or even according to yesterday Telegraph a referendum on British EU membership Admittedly that demand came from Mark Pritchard MP a nice fellow but not the sharpest pencil in the called the EU an occupying force which shows he does quite get what that phrase EU member states except Britain and Sweden were subject to domestic tyranny or foreign occupation some more than once in the century They know the difference as Pritchard evidently does not A resumption of protectionism is increasingly on the cards Scary stuff though not all Lib Dems think so Chris Huhne is cheerful and the party conference tone is curiously admits that as party leader he hopelessly lost the battle to shape public opinion in a direction Indeed he did So it was fascinating to hear Nick Clegg make a determined effort not to abandon the standard when he popped up on Radio Today programme at breakfast time The tireless Andy Sparrow covers it in his conference live blog beginning at around DPM said he was still advocating British membership of the eurozone He ruled it out for the current parliament but would go further than that No one predicted what would happen he insisted which is true At the time advocates dismissed the idea that weak southern EU members including Italy would be allowed to join You ca have a currency without a state critics Clegg was on firmer ground when he said Germany and Italy were to blame for abandoning the rules of their own stability pact which was meant to discipline sovereign borrowing to no more than of GDP if I recall Nor should debt be above 60 yet Italy was 115 when it joined That roughly what it remains incidentally My own view remains that if the disciplines and they were strict fiscal disciplines on which the euro was originally launched had been respected and adhered to the euro would not now be in the trouble that it is Clegg not persuaded but it a courageous stance to take when others are diving off the EU boat He deserves some credit but he wo get Democrat conference Democrat conferencePaddy AshdownChinaMichael 2011 Guardian News and

Since the late China has moved from a closed centrally planned system to a more one that plays a major global role in 2010 China became the world largest exporter Reforms began with the phasing out of collectivized agriculture and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices fiscal decentralization increased autonomy for state enterprises creation of a diversified banking system development of stock markets rapid growth of the private sector and opening to foreign trade and investment China has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion In recent years China has renewed its support for enterprises in sectors it considers important to economic security explicitly looking to foster globally competitive national champions After keeping its currency tightly linked to the US dollar for years in July 2005 China revalued its currency by against the US dollar and moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies From mid 2005 to late 2008 cumulative appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar was more than 20 but the exchange rate remained virtually pegged to the dollar from the onset of the global financial crisis until June 2010 when Beijing allowed resumption of a gradual appreciation The restructuring of the economy and resulting efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in GDP since 1978 Measured on a purchasing power parity PPP basis that adjusts for price differences China in 2010 stood as the economy in the world after the US having surpassed Japan in 2001 The dollar values of China agricultural and industrial output each exceed those of the US China is second to the US in the value of services it produces Still per capita income is below the world average The Chinese government faces numerous economic challenges including a reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low domestic demand b sustaining adequate job growth for tens of millions of migrants and new entrants to the work force c reducing corruption and other economic crimes and d containing environmental damage and social strife related to the economy rapid transformation Economic development has progressed further in coastal provinces than in the interior and approximately 200 million rural laborers and their dependents have relocated to urban areas to find work One consequence of the one child policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world Deterioration in the environment notably air pollution soil erosion and the steady fall of the water table especially in the north is another problem China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic development The Chinese government is seeking to add energy production capacity from sources other than coal and oil focusing on nuclear and alternative energy development In 2009 the global economic downturn reduced foreign demand for Chinese exports for the first time in many years but China rebounded quickly outperforming all other major economies in 2010 with GDP growth around 10 The economy appears set to remain on a strong growth trajectory in 2011 lending credibility to the stimulus policies the regime rolled out during the global financial crisis The government vows in the Plan adopted in March 2011 to continue reforming the economy and emphasizes the need to increase domestic consumption in order to make the economy less dependent on exports for GDP growth in the future However China likely will make only marginal progress toward these rebalancing goals in 2011 Two economic problems China currently faces are inflation which late in 2010 surpassed the government target of and local government debt which swelled as a result of stimulus policies and is largely and potentially

Thu Jun 16 2011 By Chris Buckley BEIJING Reuters Pelting rain in parts of central and southern China has forced hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and prompted the government to demand safety checks on vulnerable dams news reports said on Thursday The torrential rains have ended a drought in many areas but now threaten the Yangtze River basin and nearby provinces with floods and mudslides that have killed at least 105 people In Jiangxi province in east China troops helped residents move from vulnerable areas said the China News Service In Hubei province in the center downpours two days ago triggered a landslide that left six people missing and blocked the Pingdu River forcing residents to flee in case a wall of water burst through the mud and debris Many small dams face major hazards said China Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters adding that all areas must pay high attention to the safety of dams and hydro stations In Zhejiang an eastern province with many manufacturers officials moved residents as surging flood waters cut hundreds of roads and drove the Qiantang River to its highest flood peak since 1955 Xinhua news agency reported late on Thursday Forecasters warned that in the coming days rains could bring fresh dangers including in the southwest Tonight the rains will start from Sichuan province and Chongqing and move east said meteorologist Li Xiaoquan according to China weather news website The national forecaster also said heavy showers could hit Guangdong the province next to Hong Kong Floods and mudslides caused by the rain have killed at least 105 people and 65 are missing the state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday No official tally of the total number of deaths has been issued since then Reporting by Chris Buckley editing by Tim Pearce 

BEIJING More than million people have been displaced or otherwise affected by flooding in eastern China that is also pushing up food prices state media reported Sunday Torrential rains have left huge areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces under water with more than million acres hectares of farmland inundated the official Xinhua News Agency said Almost businesses have been forced to suspend operations and million people have had their lives disrupted Xinhua said in a brief report More than homes collapsed or were otherwise damaged and direct financial damage was estimated at almost billion yuan 930 million The downpour triggered a mudslide that buried houses and killed two people in Zhejiang Changshan county while two more were killed and two left missing by flooding in Hubei Xinhua said Flooding in eastern and southern China this month has left more than 170 people dead or missing Roads and railways have been blocked but aid supplies are arriving and the country weather bureau says skies are expected to clear up Monday Farmers quoted by Xinhua said the flooding was the worst in 20 years reducing vegetable output by 20 percent and also causing shortages of fruits and grains Prices for green vegetables were up 40 percent Xinhua said adding to an inflation rate of percent a high The increase in the consumer price index reported last week was in line with expectations but higher than April percent and March percent The National Statistics Bureau said the main factor was an percent jump in food prices Higher food prices blamed on flooding were also reported in the eastern provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi Xinhua said 

This much should be evident During the drought the had impounded water that was used to alleviate the drought Without the dam there would not be any available water at all As another commentator said millions flooded out everything in China is large numbers That impounded water still barely made an impression on the parched lands as it affected several tens of thousands of square miles 

Now we have this 50 year flood Again without the to hold back the up river waters had the rainstorms reached the upper reaches of the Yangtze the floods downriver would have been even more devastating and affect an even bigger area No the rains have reached there yet But at least there is the very significant comfort that should it rain excessively there the runoff wo reach downriver unrestricted to add to the downriver miseries Any overabundance of water can be be held back by the for a controlled release Nothing much can be done to control the current downriver floods With the it is assured that it wo get any worse 

Hope the people are found and returned to normal soon If the region is a natural flood zone or new farming district did the dams impact natural flow of water Is the draining system updated to all connect and filter somewhere needed To sump pump it out and put where lacking water would make sense pooled and filtered Could the crops be pulled from the water and transplanted to other regions or rooftops to grow May the wasted infrared glasses around here be put to better use with the military on after storm units for trouble as this Move the displaced into hotels nearby Dievs to you Maija from Detroit
